I saw him at one event, and I hid. I had to be at the event. I hid for as long as I could,” O’Connell, 41, recalled during the “Allegedly with Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss” podcast. “When it was time to disperse, I literally was the first at valet.”</p><p>In the three-minute 2008 parody, the dad of two mimicked a past interview Cruise did about Scientology, even imitating the star’s famous cackle. O’Connell — who also produced the footage — admitted Tuesday that he still “sort of avoids” Cruise, but doesn’t believe there would be a confrontation if they ever came face-to-face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“It was rude what I did. I know I’m going to be followed [by Scientologists] and I watched that documentary [Going Clear]. No, I’m kidding,” O’Connell said, laughing. “Scientology is a weird place. That documentary wasn’t that amazing. I thought it was going to be amazing. That was event television for me. I’m 41. I don’t know if Scientology is right in my wheelhouse.”</p><p>But it is for some of his friends. <strong>Rebecca Romijn’s </strong>husband said that he’s had pals who joined the Church of Scientology. He never joined, but he was invited to an afterparty at the Celebrity Center in L.A. two decades ago.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There’s no rules about drinking or not in Scientology. Those people party,” O’Connell said during the podcast. “Everyone was walking in the gates, and you’re sort of drunkenly stumbling and you’re happy to not have to drive anywhere. This is before Uber, kids.”</p><p>He continued: “A group of them all went in. I was with my brother. And my brother was like, ‘Oh no, we can’t do this.’ And they were all walking in like, ‘Come on in! Come on! Don’t be lame! The night is young.’ My brother and I were stumbling down Franklin Ave at 2:30 in the morning. That’s how they get you.”</p><p>Watch the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaKnxm67wqilp52coXqptcNmnaunnWLBsLmMnKmuoaOaeqKy056pZqWRoLavs4yfrKdln5t6tK%2FInqWtp5yktLp5kWlobmpoZn1w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
