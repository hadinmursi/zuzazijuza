Oh, how the trends have changed! These days, it’s all about filling your brows in so they’re as thick and prominent as can be.</p><p>We don’t think anyone ever held the title of “eyebrow queen” before <strong>Anastasia Soare</strong> (founder of cosmetics brand Anastasia Beverly Hills) burst onto the scene, and with good reason! Her claim to makeup fame is her impressive expertise in the brow department, and celebrities like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> have trusted her to create the perfect arches to effortlessly frame the eyes for years. In fact, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star once said her go-to everyday brow is created with the brand’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">massively popular brow pencil</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Anastasia-Beverly-Hills-Brow-Wiz.jpg><p><strong>See it!

The KKW Beauty mogul insisted that she was in charge of her own brows, but when she finally allowed the Hollywood fixture to do them, she was blown away. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">This brow pencil</a> quickly became a mainstay in Kardashian’s daily makeup routine, and her longtime makeup artist and collaborator <strong>Mario Dedivanovic </strong>is also said to be a fan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Anastasia-Beverly-Hills-Brow-Wiz-2.jpg><p><strong>See it!

She admits that she didn’t realize just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">how important brows are</a> when creating a makeup look — and her glam routine has been different ever since!</p><p>With plenty of practice and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Brow Wiz pencil</a> on hand, you too have the power to create brows that are as incredible as Kardashian’s!
