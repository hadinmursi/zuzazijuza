Rich, who starred in all 112 episodes of the popular ABC dramedy Eight Is Enough, died at age 54 at his home in Los Angeles on January 8. A family member confirmed the news <a href=#>to TMZ</a>, but no cause of death was initially shared. Law enforcement told TMZ at the time that Rich was found dead with no suspicion of foul play. The Los Angeles Medical Examiner-Coroner‚Äôs autopsy report states that Rich died due to ‚Äúeffects of fentanyl‚Äù and lists his death as accidental. <a href=#>Per Deadline</a>, his bloodstream also showed nontoxic levels of alcohol and a generic anxiety medication.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcnq4khi003e3b6vicw7cjzz@published data-word-count=124>Born on October 12, 1968 in Brooklyn, Rich rose to fame as the child actor who played Nicholas, the youngest Bradford kid on Eight Is Enough. The hit show ran from 1977 to 1981 and also starred Dick Van Patten, Betty Buckley, Lani O‚ÄôGrady, Grant Goodeve, and more. ‚ÄúI think [Rich is] why the show was a big success,‚Äù Van Patten said in a 2011 <a href=#>interview</a>. ‚ÄúPeople loved him! They named their child Nicholas and everything because of him. ‚Ä¶ He was cute, and he was a good actor. He was very natural.‚Äù Rich went on to appear in several shows and TV movies, including Code Red, Fantasy Island, and Baywatch. He also voiced Presto the Magician on the animated series Dungeons & Dragons.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcnq2xs700343b6v9c09yr09@published data-word-count=138>In his personal life, Rich reportedly had a history of substance-abuse struggles, making headlines in 1991 for breaking into a pharmacy. The Los Angeles Times <a href=#>reported</a> that his onscreen dad, Van Patten, paid his bail. Rich entered a rehab program the following year. <a href=#>Per CBS</a>, Rich was later arrested in 2002 for charges of driving under the influence, but denied the charges and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been sober for ten years.‚Äù One of Rich‚Äôs last screen credits was the 2003 movie Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, in which he made a cameo as himself. He was also featured in CNN‚Äôs 2021 series The History of the Sitcom. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for the joy felt while working on 8! ‚Ä¶‚Äù he reflected <a href=#>on Instagram</a> at the time. ‚ÄúI do hope it may have brought you some joy as well ‚Ä¶ üôèüèº‚Äù</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clj9i2734000o3b6xh98r3cq0@published data-word-count=5>This post has been updated.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>TMZ</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjhc9zv2f0055giyec5tb95fw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The 100 TV Comedies Everyone Should Watch</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckxtfqi7k0000cqn1qgr0lb1f@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>34 TV Shows We Can‚Äôt Wait to See this Summer</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl09w9w5j0000ltnbgqx8fbrj@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Best TV of 2022</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Eight Is Enough Star Adam Rich‚Äôs Cause of Death Revealed</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdga3ymtcahq2aho2Kyr7vUoJ9mq6SWv26tw5qkZqqZmLVusMSam2aZpGKCdXrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
