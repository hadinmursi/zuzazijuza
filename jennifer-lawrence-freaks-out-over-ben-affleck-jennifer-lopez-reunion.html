The pair got engaged in November 2002, but two years later, they called it quits. Earlier this year, fans wondered whether <a href=#>sparks were flying between the two</a> once again when the Second Act star was spotted hanging out with Affleck in Los Angeles following her April split from <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a>.</p><p>Weeks later, the pair were <a href=#>photographed together in Big Sky, Montana</a>, over Mother’s Day weekend. “It was just the two of them on vacation together. Big Sky is a special place to Ben,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly. “They looked very happy together.”</p><p>The “Get Right” songstress and the Argo director have <a href=#>maintained a close friendship</a> in the years since calling off their engagement — and <a href=#>some members of their inner circles aren’t shocked</a> to see them spending time together again.</p><p>“[They’ve] always loved each other,” a second source revealed, while a third insider noted that “things progressed” after the duo “had a heart-to-heart” about their romantic ups and downs. (Affleck, for his part, split from <a href=#><strong>Ana de Armas</strong></a> in January.)</p><p>Neither Lopez nor the Gone Girl actor have publicly discussed their recent hangouts, but Rodriguez, 45, <a href=#>seemingly broke his silence on the situation</a> with a shady comment. When asked about his former fiancée’s Montana getaway in a video posted by Page Six on Tuesday, May 11, the ex-MLB player simply said, “Go Yankees.” Affleck is famously a supporter of the New York team’s rival, the Boston Red Sox.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite his recent breakup, <a href=#>the retired athlete is “still holding out hope”</a> that he and Lopez can work things out. “Alex was jealous that Jen and Ben were seeing each other,” a source exclusively told Us.</p><p>The Shotgun Wedding actress was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Ojani Noa</strong></a> from 1997 to 1998, to <a href=#><strong>Cris Judd</strong></a> from 2001 to 2002, and to <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a> from 2004 to 2014. She shares twins Emme and Max, 13, with the “Vivir Mi Vida” crooner, 52.</p><p>Affleck shares daughters Violet, 15, and Seraphina, 12, and son Samuel, 9, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0Wajmq%2BimruksYyfqZ6Zm6h6sMHTZqavnaJir6a6jJqdn6SVmLhutsSnpaKelad6rbvPnrFmqpWqu6q7zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
