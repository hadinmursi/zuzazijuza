The pop superstar, 24, and the Flaming Lips frontman, 55, first connected over Twitter. In January 2014, the “Wrecking Ball” singer wished Coyne happy birthday, tweeting, “one of my favorite artists OF alllllll time.”
“I tweeted her back my phone number and said: ‘Text me,’” he told The Guardian."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In January 2014, the “Wrecking Ball” singer wished Coyne happy birthday, tweeting, “one of my favorite artists OF alllllll time.”</p><p>“I tweeted her back my phone number and said: ‘Text me,’” he told <i>The Guardian</i>. “Since then, we’ve texted each other every day. I’ll say, ‘What are you doing?’ and she’ll send me pictures of herself peeing. Sometimes it’s 1,000 times a day, sometimes it’s a couple of times a day, but we’re always in each other’s lives.”</p><p>The pair then started to work together when Cyrus made cameos on The Flaming Lips’ cover album of The Beatles’ iconic <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>, <i>With A Little Help From My Fwends</i>. Then the rocker, along with his bandmate <b>Steven Drozd</b>, co-wrote the former Disney star’s next album, <i>Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz</i>. Earlier this week, Cyrus and the Flaming Lips released a new song and music video for the single "We Are Family" off the band's album <i>OCZY MLODY,</i> out January 13.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Coyne also spilled on the “Adore You” singer’s hard-partying ways. “[<b>A$AP Rocky</b> had] just got a new set of gold teeth, braces things, and he was talking about taking acid,” he said. “In between, Miley was whispering: ‘He’s never really taken acid. He’s just saying that because he wants to write music about taking acid.’ He would keep talking and she would go: ‘He doesn’t know anything about acid.’ She’d know. Cyrus has done acid plenty."</p><p>The two eccentric stars plan to keep working together on Cyrus’ next musical endeavor. “She’s going to keep being a judge on <i>The Voice</i>, but I know she wants to make music at the same time,” Coyne said. “I’m thinking of a way we can make a record without her having to sit there for months and months. I think she likes it when it’s like: ‘You guys do some of the work, and then I get to come in and do something really cool.’"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawmamjsm6vzrKlnmWimsOmrcusZKahnJrGbq%2FYq6ysZaSitm7AxLGroqaXYrWirsitZLBsZmWFeYCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
