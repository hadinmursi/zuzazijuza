Lol,” Ice-T, 64, <a href=#>wrote via Twitter</a> on Monday, February 13.</p><p>The <a href=#>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</a> actor’s response came one week after a woman named Maureen on social media raised eyebrows for her comments about Austin, 43, who attended the Grammys with her husband on February 5.</p><p>For the event, the model wore a form-fitting, nude and crystal gown. The troll later tweeted and seemingly deleted a message about Austin from the awards show. She followed it up by <a href=#>writing</a>: “To those of you who thought my opinion of a woman named Coco (don’t know who she is … don’t care).”</p><p>Maureen added, “I see <a href=#><strong>Adele</strong></a> at the Grammies. [sic] She looks fabulous. When she was heavier, she was classy, that is a woman who knows her beauty doesn’t have to be wrapped in a dress 3 sizes too small.”</p><p>Ice-T proceeded to troll the user on Monday in a follow-up tweet, <a href=#>writing</a>, “I gotta say Maureen. You’re Hot as F…. 🔥,” alongside a blurry picture of the fan.</p><p>The “99 Problems” rapper <a href=#>added</a>: “We NEVER attack… But we RETALIATE. 💥💥💥💥.”</p><p>Many of Ice-T’s followers took issue with the woman coming after his spouse and shared their frustration on social media. “Who dubbed YOU [the] ‘fashion police?’” one Twitter user asked, while another wrote, “Don’t come for Coco. She doesn’t bother anyone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ice-T-Slams-Troll-Claiming-Coco-Austins-Dress-Was-Small-Grammys-2023-2.jpg><p>Maureen, for her part, claimed her thoughts about Austin were “just an observation.” However, she later doubled down on her comments, <a href=#>tweeting on Monday</a>, “Women should be proud of their natural beauty,” seemingly referring to Austin’s boob job. “Instead of being done doctors Frankenstein.”</p><p>Ice-T, meanwhile, <a href=#>concluded his social media clap back</a> by seemingly telling all his fans to take the high road. “Ya know what Kills people that Hate you the most?? That OTHER people Love you. 💎,” <a href=#>he wrote via Twitter</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>New Jack City actor</a> — <a href=#>who wed Austin in Las Vegas on New Year’s Eve 2001</a> before making things legal in 2006 — has a history of defending his wife. He is also known for making jokes about how much other men gawk at Austin.</p><p>After going to the Grammys on February 5, Ice-T shared a video via Instagram of <a href=#>a man checking out the California native during the awards show</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Lol … I love how the white dude looked at me then took time to check Coco out … I TOTALLY understand …💎,” the rapper captioned the February 6 clip of his partner dancing in her sexy ensemble while a random man stood beside the couple and took a long look at Austin.</p><p>The couple’s relationship has become even stronger since they welcomed their daughter, Chanel, in November 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaim5ViwW6%2Fy5qkrGWkp7ytuIyorZ6qXZi5orXMrGScp5OkeqLB0q2gp6tdmb%2Bmv9JmrpqrXam8sHnSppilpF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
