How does a new dress sound to you? It’s a rhetorical question, of course. A new dress always sounds amazing, no matter what. It might sound the absolute best right now though, since we’re right at the start of dress season."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s a rhetorical question, of course. A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">new dress</a> always sounds amazing, no matter what. It might sound the absolute best right now though, since we’re right at the start of dress season. It’s time to get flowy, twirly and light!</p><p>Of course, we’re looking at dresses with short sleeves and short hems right now, having officially stored our sweater dresses away for the next handful of months. We also want dresses that are easy to wear — something we can just toss on to instantly feel great. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This Romwe dress</a> is a perfect example!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Romwe Short-Sleeve V-Neck Summer Short Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, March 21, 2022, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This is a wrap-style dress, so you get the surplice neckline and the cinched waist, but there’s no actual wrapping involved on your part. The flattering design is permanently fixed into place, making getting dressed as simple as slipping this piece over your head. It also has fluttery short sleeves that are just stunning for spring, as well as a mini hem with a little bit of flow, hitting above the knees!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This lightweight dress</a> comes in a bunch of different variations, so we highly recommend hovering over all of the photo thumbnails on Amazon. We first fell in love with the textured fabric pictured above, but we quickly came to adore the patterned, silkier fabrics as well. You can never go wrong with a dainty dot print or floral!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Romwe Short-Sleeve V-Neck Summer Short Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22</a> at Amazon!

We’d love to see it with combat boots and a leather jacket too once fall rolls around again!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Romwe Short-Sleeve V-Neck Summer Short Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22</a> at Amazon!
