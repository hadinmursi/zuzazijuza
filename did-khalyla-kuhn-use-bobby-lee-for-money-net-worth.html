The TigerBelly podcast is one that seemingly blew up out of nowhere, with nearly 800K subscribers since its launch in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the draws of the series was inarguably Khalyla Kuhn, who was Bobby Lee's girlfriend when the podcast began. But after <a href=#>their long-term relationship fizzled out</a>, both Khalyla and Bobby continued to appear on the podcast together, while fans speculated about the pair's relationship—and some suggested there were red flags a long time ago.</p><h2 id=people-have-speculated-that-khalyla-kuhn-used-bobby-lee>People Have Speculated That Khalyla Kuhn Used Bobby Lee</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/what-bobby-lee-s-ex-wife-khalyla-kuhn-really-thinks-of-brendan-schaub_.jpg><p>Given how successful both Khalyla Kuhn and Bobby Lee became thanks to the TigerBelly podcast, plenty of critics suspected that was somehow Khalyla's original goal in dating Bobby. Of course, the two are said to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started dating in 2013 after meeting on Tinder</a>, long before the podcast was launched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bobby also clapped back against critics who thought his ex used him, pointing out that they "created TigerBelly together" and that they still cared deeply for each other even after their split.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Bobby Lee Has Been Up To Since ‘Mad TV’</a></span></p><p>He even laid out the facts point-blank, saying, "When I met Khalyla, I had no money... All the things I have in my life are the direct result of her and me building a business together. It rekindled my acting career. Without her, I don't know where I'd be."</p><p>Yet there are still many "fans" who think that Bobby fell into some sort of trap, and there are a couple of specific reasons why.</p><h2 id=who-was-khalyla-kuhn-before-the-tiger-belly-show>Who Was Khalyla Kuhn Before The Tiger Belly Show?</h2><p>Many fans of Bobby Lee hadn't heard of Khalyla Kuhn before she met and started working with Bobby. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many Redditors</a> recalled her first appearance on a podcast Bobby Lee used to appear on (DVDASA).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Therefore, they were understandably suspicious about her cozying up to their favorite comedian, although many didn't hesitate to admit that Bobby probably isn't the easiest to love.</p><p>Fans pointed out that Khalyla was apparently a nurse prior to meeting Bobby and the two starting their podcast, which makes sense given how much of a "codependent" relationship the two had, according to the same fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Joe Rogan Actually Pay His Podcast Guests?</a></span></p><p>Given what Bobby has revealed about his life through the TigerBelly podcast, it's clear, they suggest, that Khalyla steered the ship in terms of their relationship. While Bobby admitted he would be nothing without her, many fans suspected that the pair breaking up would leave Bobby in a tough spot, especially because the two were still living together a few months after their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there's also some speculation, based on Kuhn's own comments, that she was never actually a nurse and didn't even graduate from nursing school.</p><h2 id=bobby-lee-39-s-fans-dislike-khalyla-kuhn>Bobby Lee's Fans Dislike Khalyla Kuhn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bobby-lee-and-khalyla-khun-on-about-last-night.jpg><p>Clearly, fans of Bobby Lee are fine with admitting his faults, but they also felt the need to drag Khalyla Kuhn over the way she acted in the pair's relationship and label her the villain.</p><p>Looking farther back into Khalyla Kuhn's life before Bobby Lee, from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her own admissions in various podcast episodes</a>, some super sleuth fans dove into Khalyla's past and her own words about the way she treats Bobby (and past partners, among other people).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They quoted poems where Khalyla talked about intentionally getting pregnant, only to end the pregnancies, and quoted her podcast quips where she stated she and Bobby didn't have babies but that they had ended the lives of two. In quoting Khalyla's poetry purportedly written about the incidents, it sounds as if she planned the pregnancies on purpose, only to end them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Exclusive: Salice Rose Has Just Launched Her Very First Podcast, And We've Got The Scoop</a></span></p><p>Some of Khalyla's podcast commentary also suggested that she had "dirt" on Bobby and that he could never betray her, which Bobby corroborated. That seemed a lesser offense, and possibly a joke, than some of the other content compiled in an effort to drag Khalyla.</p><p>Other parts of her poetry and podcast statements speak about hurting animals, abusing younger relatives, and more. She also talks about being abused often as a child, specifically her mother physically abusing her. However, many of the comments were almost positive, in that Khalyla seemed to say (and write in her poetry) that she enjoyed the experiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, critics think that Khalyla didn't necessarily plot to take advantage of Bobby, but only that she entered the relationship with bad intentions and an inability to actually care for anyone other than herself.</p><p>Online gossip also suggests that Khalyla stepped out on the relationship (which she denies), but <a href=#>a feud with Brendan Schaub</a>, a former friend of the former couple, only stirred the speculation more.</p><p>Khalyla and Bobby had Brendan on the TigerBelly podcast, but all that did was <a href=#>make Khalyla's contempt for Brendan even clearer</a>.</p><h2 id=khalyla-kuhn-is-worth-around-1-million-and-so-is-bobby>Khalyla Kuhn Is Worth Around $1 Million (And So Is Bobby)</h2><p>According to multiple sources, Khalyla Kuhn and Bobby Lee are both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth around $1 million</a>. It's unclear exactly how much money the podcast brings in, or whether Kuhn has other professional dealings in terms of sponsorships and social media deals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It would make sense for Kuhn and Lee to have separate finances, given that they were never married, but because they did live together (along with some family members), it's possible they did commingle their money—and may have trouble disentangling it now that they've split.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoLWiuNilmGajpZ27bsHSnmSbp5KXxm64xJ5kn6eiYrqwusSyZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
