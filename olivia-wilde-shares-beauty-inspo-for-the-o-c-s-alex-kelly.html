Olivia Wilde shared that the iconic beauty inspiration behind Alex Kelly, her character on The O.C., was Gwen Stefani. Obviously, this revelation is basically an early 2000s dream come true.
As for how this information came to light? Well, it all went down on Twitter thanks to Danny Pellegrino.
The comedian posted a throwback picture of Alex Kelly working at the bait shop. In the photo, Wilde is rocking some majorly tweezed, uber-high arched eyebrows, thick black eyeliner and a hair poof that would give Snookie a run for her money."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That‚Äôs right, Alex Kelly‚Äôs brows were the victims of over-plucking, the iconic high pony was inspired in part by a children‚Äôs cartoon and pretty much the character‚Äôs entire vibe took a note from Stefani‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust a Girl‚Äù era.</p><p class=p1>Loyal O.C. fans obviously responded to this wild revelation.
