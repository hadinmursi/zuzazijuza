Their wedding day was documented on the E! reality series that August. “I just love being able to call him my husband,” the former WWE star, who used the ring name Kelly Kelly, gushed to <a href=#><i>The Knot</i></a> ahead of the emotional episode.</p><p>“I think it’s the coolest thing,” she continued at the time. “I’m just like, [singing] ‘This is my husband!’ I just love it! … I mean, nothing’s really changed. I think it’s just exciting that we’re husband and wife. It’s like him and me now. It’s so special — that feeling.”</p><p></p><p>Blank and the former NHL player even tuned into WAGS to relive their big day. “I’m so proud of it,” she told <i>The Knot</i>&nbsp;in August 2016. “I just can’t wait for [our fans] to feel like they were there, to see our love, our family and friends. I’m just excited. I think it’s gonna be really entertaining. There were lots of ups and downs … But on the day, everything was so perfect — above and beyond what I ever imagined. It literally was the happiest day of our lives.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The reality star previously dated fellow wrestler Andrew “Test” Martin for two and a half years until he died of an accidental overdose in March 2009.</p><p><i>WAGS LA</i> season 3 returns on E!
