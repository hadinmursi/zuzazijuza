Young makes sure that she’s always putting her best dace forward by starting her day <a href=#>tending to her skin with some tried-and-true products</a>. “I love the <a href=#>Youth Corridor Ultimate Antioxidant Boost Vitamin C Serum</a>,” she tells Us. “It’s the best and I’ve tried everything,” she confessed.</p><p>Young makes it a point to share her beauty tips — which include a muscle-toning treatment and daily boxing workouts — and business advice with the aspiring models that she mentors. “I do their makeup and hair [for test shoots],” she tells Us about sharing her the knowledge she’s gained over her decades-long career with the next generation of supermodels. “It feels good to help however I can.”</p><p>The entrepreneur — who rose to fame in the early 1990s after starring in campaigns for Revlon, Maybelline and Victoria’s Secret — works with her son, photographer <strong>Nick D’Orazio</strong>, on those test shoots. “He grew up on photoshoots, on Victoria’s Secret sets, he’d assist his dad [ex-husband <strong>Sante D’Orazio</strong>],” Young said during an interview with <a href=#>The Magazine by Julia James</a> in January. “It was just his life. I love working with him because it’s the happiest he is to me.”</p><p>She continued: “<a href=#>I also do hair and makeup with him</a> when he works with models. That’s been a bonding thing for us. It’s the only time he can sort of talk down to me and say ‘I want you to do it this way.’ <a href=#>He loves it because of that, but it’s a bonding thing for us</a>. I don’t do it all the time, maybe one out of every 10 shoots. But when I do, we’ll pick the makeup, hair, and clothes together. That creative process is great for our relationship.”</p><p>Young, who also shares son Constantine with husband <strong>Peter Georgiopoulos</strong>, was briefly married to Sante, 66, in the early 1990s. Following their split, the Coming to America actress met former president <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> at a party in the Hamptons in 1995. <a href=#>The pair dated for about two years</a> but called it quits in 1997. She moved on with Georgiopoulos and the pair tied the knot in 2005. Despite their high-profile careers, Young does her best to savor the little moments she shares at home with her family.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s very cathartic for me [to cook dinner],” the California native tells Us in the new issue, adding that she tried to cook for her family at least three times a week. “I love how food brings people together.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see what Young gets up to in a typical day before sitting down for a meal with her loved ones:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKK%2BwGawqK2enHqiecOasGahnmK6unnLop2eZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
