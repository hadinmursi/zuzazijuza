Loughlin and Giannulli’s two daughters, <strong>Bella</strong> and<a href=#><strong> Olivia Jade</strong></a>, attended the school, but Us Weekly confirmed in October 2019 that they were no longer enrolled.</p><p>The bribe money was donated to <strong>William Rick Singer</strong>’s fake charity, and <a href=#>CNN</a> reported that Giannulli had sent a friendly email to the man behind the scam about their eldest daughter’s excitement to be admitted into the University of Southern California.</p><p>“I wanted to thank you again for your great work with [our daughter], she is very excited and both Lori and I are very appreciative of your efforts and end result!” an alleged email from Giannulli to Singer read.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hours after news broke of the scam, <a href=#>Giannulli was arrested</a>&nbsp;and later let go on a $1 million bond. The When Calls the Heart star, for her part, was “out of the country” and was <a href=#>taken into custody</a> the following day. She too had bail set at $1 million. They pleaded not guilty to fraud and money laundering charges before accepting a plea deal and serving time behind bars.</p><p>Scroll down to take a look back at Loughlin and Giannulli’s relationship timeline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkubC%2ByGajqK2XnbmquoyapZ1lnaTAtLXMqGSgoZGju7a4y6KqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
