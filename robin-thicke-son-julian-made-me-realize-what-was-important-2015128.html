It helps you gain perspective on what’s important in life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>That time off included taking his mom,<strong> Gloria Loring</strong>, on their first vacation together in years with his son.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I hadn’t gotten to take my mom on vacation for a long time, so it was really a magical trip for us,” he said. “I spent so much time with my son and that just made me realize what was most important.”</p><p>Now Thicke is back, refreshed from his time off, and has a new song — “Back Together.” Many fans speculated that the tune was about Patton, but Thicke told GMA co-anchor <strong>Robin Roberts</strong> that he didn’t even write the tune.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just heard this idea of getting back together and getting yourself back together,” he said of his new single. “What I was going through at the time, I really related to that and connected with it. It’s more about the theme of getting yourself back together with love and partnership.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Keu27Ax6KapJ1dqLyvecmuo6KZnmK6orDEZqSeZaKarq212Z5ksKCRqXq4rdJmoKaon6fBorrTZmlpaWVmf3l7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
