There’s no shortage of bows, ruffles, plaid and toile.</p><p>The cutest part? One of the standout prints in the collection is a baby and momma deer design. It’s meant to symbolize the joy that Hadid’s daughter <a href=# rel=noopener>Khai</a>, 2, has brought into her life since she and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Zayn Malik</strong></a> welcomed the baby into the world in September 2020.</p><p>Naturally, Hadid and her little one are already big fans of the brand. Last June, the mother-daughter duo <a href=# rel=noopener>was photographed</a> wearing custom green gingham print Frankies Bikinis suits.</p><p>For some background, the brand was founded by Hadid’s longtime friend <a href=# rel=noopener>Francesca Aiello</a> in 2012. The pair grew up together in Malibu and have been each other’s biggest cheerleaders through the years as they pursued their dreams in fashion.</p><p>“Gigi is someone that is so special and so inspiring to me,” said the founder and creative director in a statement shared with Us Weekly’s Stylish. “She is creative, hard working, kind and loving, and combining those incredible personality traits with our deep-rooted friendship is what really made this collection not only fun to create together but also to shoot together.”</p><p>They even recruited another childhood best friend — <a href=# rel=noopener>Alana O’Herlihy</a> — to shoot the campaign imagery. The duo modeled the sexy swimsuit styles on a farm, a significant change from the red carpet.</p><p>“We designed this collection with so much love and I believe that really shines through in the details within the fabrics, prints, and styles we chose to use,” said Hadid.</p><p>“Both Frank and I have very social lives but also are big homebodies, and the collection really embodies that side of us,” she continued.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The collection will boast a whopping 98 pieces in total and will be released in two drops: the first on May 11 and the second on June 2.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a collection preview — and <a href=# rel=noopener>click here</a> to sign up for early access.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvFq5ino5mawG6uyKSgp6GjYsVus8igoGagkZm2pXnCqKOlnZOptrC6jJ6tnqqpqbWqusZmsKitXaOyprCMraZmo56kxHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
