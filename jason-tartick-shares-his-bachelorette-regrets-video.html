Jason Tartick revealed what he does and doesn’t regret about his time on The Bachelorette in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.
“I do regret not wearing more comfortable shoes to rose ceremonies,” the New York native, 32, said. “I remember one time Jordan Kimball wore a robe and I was very jealous of that.”
As for his kissing skills, the former corporate banker has no regrets either, though he said the thought “always makes me blush."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After he was let go, Tartick went to 30-year-old Kufrin’s hotel room <a href=#>to lay his feelings out and give her a scrapbook</a> he’d made about their relationship.</p><p>“I don’t regret that for me. It was a way of closing the door, and it was a necessity to move on to the next chapter,” the University of Rochester alum said.</p><p>Though Tartick and Kufrin did not end up together, they remain close friends. When the former contestant looks back on his time shedding tears over the Minnesota native, he’s happy his pain allowed him to get to know himself more closely.</p><p>“It was all was one of the things that helped me really connect, I guess, more emotionally with myself, which is something that is so important, something I put off for so long,” he said. “It was probably healthy. I think I did come out more connected with myself emotionally than I went in.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bad-Shows-Becca-Jason-Tartick-Shares-His-Bachelor-Regrets-002.jpg><p>Tartick is currently dating former Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a>.
