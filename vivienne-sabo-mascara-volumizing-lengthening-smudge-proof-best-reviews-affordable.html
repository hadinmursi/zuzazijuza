Happy shopping!</p><p>At any given point in time, you can probably find Us wishing that our eyelashes were longer and more voluminous. Most mascaras come with a whole slew of problems, including clumping, smudging, flaking, drooping and just an overall lack of impressiveness. Fake lashes can be a tedious pain though — while eyelash extensions are expensive! Is it so wrong to want to add a little more glam to our look without the added time and expense?</p><p>Most other beauty lovers we talk to are on the same page as Us. So maybe we weren’t blessed with foot-long, wispy lashes. We’re not alone! That’s why mascaras like this exist. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">This French one</a> is way under budget, way over expectations and everything our smize has ever needed!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Vivienne Sabó Classic French Mascara – Cabaret Premiere</a> (originally $13) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$8</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, November 26, 2019, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>As if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this Vivienne Sabó mascara </a>weren’t already seriously affordable, it’s now under $9, which is actually wild considering how popular it is. It has over 2,200 reviews on Amazon, and shoppers can’t say enough good things about it. Even the self-proclaimed mascara snobs are calling it the best they’ve ever used! They love how it doesn’t irritate sensitive eyes and never, ever smudges. It’s not even waterproof, but they say it lasts through anything from teardrops, to eyedrops, to raindrops. This means they don’t have to constantly wipe and re-conceal their delicate eye area — and that means this mascara won’t age our skin the way others do!</p><p>This mascara is so effective that shoppers even say that others are asking if they got extensions, but all it takes is one coat in the comfort of your own home — or even on the train or bus on the way to work. One coat from the petite wand is perfect on its own, but the formula is also buildable if you want a more dramatic look!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Vivienne Sabó Classic French Mascara – Cabaret Premiere</a> (originally $13) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$8</a> at Amazon!

It should still come off with ease with makeup remover however, unlike other mascaras that stick like heavy concrete!</p><p>Grab your own magical, golden tube of this cruelty-free mascara for 35% off while you can and “bring the allure of Paris” right to your makeup bag!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Vivienne Sabó Classic French Mascara – Cabaret Premiere</a> (originally $13) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$8</a> at Amazon!
