But on the morning of Wednesday, March 27, she wasn't just telling the story — she was the story. In a special appearance on Today and, later, in a blog on the show's website, the 39-year-old NBC correspondent came out as gay and announced that she and her girlfriend, fellow NBC journalist <strong>Stephanie Gosk</strong>, are expecting a daughter at the end of August.</p><p>"Of all the jaw-dropping, head-turning, and eye-popping things I've ever told my friends and family ('I swam with killer sharks,' 'I jet-packed 30 feet out of the water,' 'I scaled the tallest building in Canada'), nothing garnered more shock and awe (and, yes, some tears) than when I told people I was pregnant," she wrote in her <a href=#>blog post</a>, the first of many installments. (No further details were provided about the baby's paternity.)</p><p>"Just writing those words — 'I'm pregnant' — is surreal to me," she continued. "After all, I was never the kid that ran around playing house. I never had daydreams about being a mom and raising a family…As a kid, I would have chosen raising my adrenaline over raising children any day of the week. But then a funny thing happened on my way to adulthood…I grew up."</p><p>Both Wolfe and Gosk — a foreign correspondent who has reported from "the most dangerous places on earth" — are noted thrill-seekers. "And yet both of us agree that THIS little girl will be the biggest and best adventure of our lives," the mom-to-be wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In part, that's because Wolfe is a self-proclaimed neophyte when it comes to babies. "I've never changed a diaper. I don't know how to decorate a nursery. I don't really understand what a breast pump is. And don't get me started on the feeding schedule," she joked.</p><p>That said, she's ready for the challenge. "Something just sort of told me it was time. Two years into a great relationship we felt like we wanted to share our adventures with a wide-eyed, little person," she explained in her blog. "The more we talked about it, the better the idea seemed. And so in December, we embarked on Operation Baby. And might I just add that despite the morning sickness, it's been the best decision we've ever made."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnZ6jrm7DzqWdnmWkpLGixYysn6ivXZa7pLTOq2Scp52awG671K1kmqtdnK66ecCnpaitnpiytHnSoZysZZWtvaav06KloGWRYq%2BirthmnqKqnGLEqsDHZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1krKyVpbWiusieZKCno6B6c3yQbGlwa18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
