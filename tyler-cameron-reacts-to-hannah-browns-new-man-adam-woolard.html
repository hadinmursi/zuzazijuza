Cameron, however, told the outlet on Tuesday that “we just cared for each other as people,” noting they remain friends.</p><p>“We want each other to be the best person we can be,” he added. “If that’s being happy with other people then that’s what we want.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Barkitecture cohost</a>, for his part, was romantically linked to model <a href=#><strong>Camila Kendra</strong></a> last month but did not confirm he is <a href=#>currently in a relationship</a>.</p><p>“I keep that world private,” he explained. “There are just things I want to do for myself and work life and construction that I am excited about.
