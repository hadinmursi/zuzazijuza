This isn’t an uncommon thing: an actor will muddle along in bit parts and guest spots for a few years, and then will eventually land a recurring role on a popular tv series. Sometimes this is a lead role, and sometimes it’s a smaller stalwart. Whatever the size, they then have an iconic portrayal to either coast off of or build off of for the rest of their lives. For example&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith</a>. Candace Cameron Bure is one of these kinds of actors, who’s gone on to have several roles after her big one on Full House. Which, we’d like to point out, she got cast in before teenagehood! Joining a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">long line of child actors</a> who did actually find success post-breakout role, Candace Cameron Bure has grown up to be kind, classy, and all manners of awesome. Her time of Full House shaped her into the actor she is today and set her up for success. The reported $100,000 she accumulated from that first big role also helps. Though, she’s grown that to almost $15 million of a net worth now, which we'll look at a little as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Lesser Known Facts About Candace Cameron's Daughter, Natasha Bure</a></span></p><h2 id=she-was-full-on-full-house>She Was Full-On Full House</h2><p>That’s not to say that she didn’t do anything <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">before or after</a>, though. “After appearing in her own share of commercials, Candace joined her brother on-screen when she landed a small role on Growing Pains. A little while later, she became DJ Tanner on Full House at the age of 11. Throughout eight seasons, fans saw Candace grow up before their eyes,” which propelled her to get even more roles in even bigger projects. Growing up in a family that embraced show business and on-screen acting was something that allowed Candace Cameron Bure this opportunity. There’s no way that she could live the normal life of an 11-year-old girl while juggling a full-time film schedule. Thus, she committed herself to the recurring role of DJ Tanner. After Full House she even kept on with the character in Fuller House, making it a character that has truly defined her life story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The amount that she got paid changes a little depending on the source, but the average seems to be around $100,000. Which, in the 1980s money, is actually quite a lot. Especially for an 11-year-old! She got paid for each episode she was on, and we’re sure she got a pay raise/bonus overtime as well judging from how essential she was to a few plot lines. This is, obviously, not including all the royalties, merch products, and appearances that she did thanks to the show. The money is counted solely from her day rate. The royalties on this would be absolutely ridiculous and absolutely contribute to her overall net worth of $15 million. But wait; $100,000 is a whole lot less than $15 million. How’d she get to that number?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are 'Full House' Stars Candace Cameron Bure And Lori Loughlin Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-incredibly-popular>She’s Incredibly Popular</h2><p>Not only in the acting world, but also in the writing world too! We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: one of the best ways to ensure a high net worth is to diversify your income streams. Whether that’s through stocks, real estate, products, or other endeavors, the artist who continues to create is the one who continues to stay in the public eye. Candace Cameron Bure had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">figured that out</a> long ago. “As Candace's publishing career was taking off, she also starred in her first Hallmark movie, Moonlight and Mistletoe in 2008. Over the past eight years, Candace has appeared in a whopping 18 Hallmark movies,” and added producer credits with Hallmark to her resume too. We can’t forget her time spent on Dancing With The Stars either, as well as her year of hosting on The View.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch Candace Bure Relatably Burst Into Tears On A Spin Bike</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All in all Candace Cameron Bure has proven that one doesn’t need to do a million projects in order to become well known. Starting at the young age of 5 and landing your first big role at 11 was enough to start Bure on the path to being a well off professional actor. While she only made $100,000 or so from her time on Full House as a kid, that wealth has exploded to be approximately $15 million; a huge boon, and entirely through her own hard work. Between the role on Fuller House and her work with Hallmark, it’s no surprice that Candace Cameron Bure has amassed such a high net worth. While she hardly came from the bottom, we’re certainly glad she’s up here! No doubt her net worth will continue to grow as time goes on; preferably through publishing another fabulous book. And hey, even if she gives up the spotlight, we’ll always have the episodes of Full House to look back on.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Married Their Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqaUlrCmecKapJ6qn6N6o8HRnmSfrZyheqm71KycZquRoa6zxYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
