“They may eventually marry but it’s never been a priority, nor has starting a family,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now. “[Winona] loves what they have and [they] are perfectly content.”
According to the insider, the couple’s connection has only gotten stronger through the years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After the fashion designer showed his support for his girlfriend at the season 1 premiere of <a href=#>Stranger Things</a>, the Minnesota native <a href=#>opened up about her thoughts on marriage.</a></p><p>“I’m a serial monogamist,” the actress told Net-a-Porter’s The Edit in July 2016. “I was single for a while and dating and I just didn’t know how to do it! I’ve always been like that. But marriage? I don’t know.”</p><p>At the time, the Crucible star gushed about <a href=#>being “happily with someone for quite a while” now</a>. “I’d rather never have been married than been divorced a few times. Not that there’s anything wrong with divorce, but I don’t think I could do it if that was a possibility,” Ryder shared. “When your parents are madly in love for 45 years, your standards are really high.”</p><p>The Heathers star <a href=#>previously made headlines for her high-profile romance</a> with <a href=#><strong>Johnny Deep</strong></a> in the ’90s. They sparked romance rumors after <a href=#>they met at a New York City film premiere in 1989</a>. Following several months of dating, Ryder and Depp, 59, <a href=#>confirmed that they were engaged.</a></p><p>“I had my first real relationship with Johnny, a fiercely deep love that I don’t know that I’ll ever [have again],” Ryder told Cinema.com in 2001. “The first love is like that isn’t it? I don’t know today. It was a real wild time back then.”</p><p>The duo<a href=#> called off their engagement after three years</a>. Following the split, the actor confirmed that <a href=#>he changed his “Winona forever” tattoo to “Wino forever.”</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s no longer there. We’ve split up,” Depp said on Australia Tonight in 1993. “I think these things, to me — these tattoos, for me — are a journal. I wear my journal. Even though we’re not together anymore, it doesn’t take away the honesty of the moment when I got the tattoo. I don’t regret that tattoo at all, in fact, it’s a part of my past.”</p><p>For more on Ryder and Hahn’s long-lasting connection, watch the video above and look for the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ51qKlqKaRYr%2B6sMSrZKybn6nBbrnAnKKippyWxm60wKGlrGWgmr%2BnscKto7Jlk6S7tbHNrWSrp52Wu6Sxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
