I mean, in the most common, prosaic way. Xanax was just lovely. Y’know, for a while. And then I realized that the gears were still smoking. I just couldn’t hear them anymore. But I could&nbsp;feel&nbsp;them, I could feel the gearbox heating up and smoke pouring out of me, but I was no longer walking around a couch.”</p><p>“I had a bit of a nervous breakdown after I got married — kind of panic attacks,” he continued. “My wife would go off to work and she’d come home — because I worked at night — and I’d be walking around the couch. And she’s like, ‘How was your day?’ And I’d say, ‘You’re looking at it.’ Just tight circles around the couch.” (The comedian wed <strong>Evelyn McGee</strong> in 1993. They share three kids: Madeleine, Peter and John.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stephen-Colbert-nervous-breakdown-after-marriage-2.jpg><p>Colbert’s anxiety became a bigger problem when his friends <a href=#><strong>Amy Sedaris</strong></a> and <strong>Paul Dinello</strong> moved away from Chicago, where they had been performing together. “I would go to the show, and I would curl up in a ball on the couch backstage and I would wait to hear my cue lines. Then I would uncurl and go onstage and I’d feel fine,” he explained. “Which occurred to me at the time: Like, ‘Oh, you feel fine when you’re out here.’ And then as soon as I got offstage, I’d just crumble into a ball again. Nobody ever asked me what was wrong! [Laughs] It went on for months.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The&nbsp;Colbert Report&nbsp;alum, who called comedy his “savior” in the interview, eventually realized medicating was not doing the trick. “I stopped the Xanax after, like, nine days. I went, ‘This isn’t helping.’ So I just suffered through it,” he said. “I’d sometimes hold the bottle, to go like, ‘I&nbsp;could&nbsp;stop this feeling if I wanted, but I’m not going to. Because I know if I stop the feeling, somehow I’m not working through it, like I have got to go through the tunnel with the spiders in it.’”</p><p>He added: “And then one morning I woke up and my skin wasn’t on fire, and it took me a while to figure out what it was. I wake up the next morning, I’m perfectly fine, to the point where my body’s&nbsp;still humming. I’m a bell that’s been rung so hard that I can still feel myself vibrating. But the actual sound was gone [because] I was starting rehearsal that day to create a new show. And then I went, ‘Oh, my God, I can never stop performing.’ Creating something is what helped me from just spinning apart like an unweighted flywheel. And I haven’t stopped since. Even when I was a writer I always had to be in front of a camera a little bit. I have to perform.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWltaa6jJympZqVp8FutMCdZJplnpq%2Ft7vUrGSbqpWWuKW71qdkmp6kmr9utMRmnqisXaKus77Inpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
