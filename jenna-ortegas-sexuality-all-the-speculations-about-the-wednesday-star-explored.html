Sorry, I look at you, I get so – my heart,” Ortega said while thanking Christie during the interview.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jenna-ortegas-sexuality-was-questioned-after-the-lgbtq-community-regarded-her-portrayal-of-wednesday-addams-as-a-%e2%80%98gay-icon></span>Jenna Ortega’s sexuality was questioned after the LGBTQ+ community regarded her portrayal of Wednesday Addams as a ‘gay icon’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jenna Ortega’s portrayal of Wednesday Addams garnered an online discourse over her sexuality after the character resonated with LGBTQ+ viewers. Wednesday was touted as a ‘gay icon’ by some members of the community.</p><p>Before the show’s premiere on Netflix, the cast of RuPaul’s Drag Race hosted a goth-themed party in homage to the aesthetic of the Addams family. During the event promoting the show, drag performer Crystal Methyd called Wednesday Addams a ‘queer icon’. She explained:</p><p>“At her core, [Wednesday] revels in being an outsider. As part of the Addams, she lives apart from mainstream culture. Instead of being shamed by the differences between her family’s way of life and that of society at large, she embraces what makes her different. She stands up for marginalized groups and faces bullies with an unflinching calm that any queer would be proud to emulate.”</p><p>Ortega also addressed the discussion surrounding Wednesday’s newfound title. While agreeing with the sentiment, she said that Wednesday is a “badass” and that is the reason she is seen as a gay icon.</p><p>“She’s cool, she’s got a nice sense of style, but she’s somebody who embraces her differences and isn’t out to please anybody. I feel like that’s a really, really powerful thing to see. I feel like people want to see powerful women with powerful women,” said Ortega.</p><p>It is safe to say that Ortega is a promoter of diversity and acceptance as she has been a supporter of the Pride Over Prejudice campaign of the DoSomething organization since she was 13 years old. The non-profit organization endorses causes for LGBTQ+ rights and equality.</p><p>“At the end of the day, you are you. You’ve got to stay true to yourself, and you can’t change yourself in order to fit in or to make someone else feel comfortable,” Ortega told Teen Vogue.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jenna-dismissed-the-rumors-of-her-past-relationships-and-has-dated-%e2%80%9cnone%e2%80%9d-of-the-alleged-partners></span>Jenna dismissed the rumors of her past relationships and has dated “none” of the alleged partners<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although not much is known about Jenna Ortega’s private life and current relationship status, she was linked with fellow Disney star Asher Angel in the past.</p><p>The duo sparked dating rumors after attending the 2018 Just Jared 7th Annual Halloween Party in a couple costume. Dressed as Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson, Ortega and Angel recreated the iconic paparazzi shot of the then-engaged couple.</p><p>Earlier that month, they had also attended the premiere of Venom in the Village Theatre in Los Angeles with a group of friends.</p><p>In 2017, Ortega was briefly linked with the singer and internet personality Jacob Sartorius after appearing in his “Chapstick” music video as a love interest. The pair shared a kiss on screen.</p><p>Ortega, who had never confirmed or denied the gossip before, finally addressed the rumored relationships in a podcast in 2019. In an episode of the Just Between Us podcast, she told hosts Bailee Madison and Kaitlin Vilasuso:</p><p>“According to the internet, I dated like six guys, [but I] dated none of them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKVo7uiec6rq56fkah6tLHXrpiloaSueqK4y2aroZ1dqL2mr9SlmK2hn6PAbq3BqKytZaSdsm7DxJ2lnquUlsZuv9OaqWadqKW5sL7EnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
