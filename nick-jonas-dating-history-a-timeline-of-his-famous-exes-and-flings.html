After rising to stardom on the Disney Channel,<a href=#><strong>&nbsp;Nick Jonas</strong></a>’ love life quickly became a hot topic of conversation.</p><p>The heartthrob originally made headlines for his love triangle with <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Selena Gomez</strong> </a>before transitioning into more low-key romances. Jonas dated <a href=#><strong>Olivia Culpo</strong></a> for two years before calling it quits in 2015. The musician was later linked to <a href=#><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Angela Sarafyan</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Georgia Fowler</strong></a>.</p><p>While attending the 2017 Met Gala, Jonas reconnected with<a href=#><strong> Priyanka Chopra-Jonas</strong></a> after previously sliding into her DMs one year prior. In May 2018, Us Weekly broke the news that <a href=#>the pair were officially dating after their reunion.</a></p><p>“People are saying it’s a great match because they’re both so talented and understand the industry. Priyanka knows how to have fun, but there’s also a gravitas to her,” a source revealed at the time. “The same goes for Nick. He’s serious but has a great sense of humor.”</p><p><a href=#>After a two-month courtship</a>, Jonas and Chopra-Jonas got engaged and <a href=#>had two wedding ceremonies in December 2018</a>. The band member later opened up about how his connection with his wife is <a href=#>different than any of his previous relationships.</a></p><p>“It’s just that magical connection you’ve got with somebody when it’s right. We’re very lucky. We knew each other well before we started dating properly, and I think that foundation as friends always helps in relationships that have evolved in an organic way,” he explained during an interview with SiriusXM in March 2021. “It’s been a wild first couple of years of marriage, and I’m very blessed to have a life partner that I can rely on, and vice versa hopefully.”</p><p>The Baywatch star, for her part, also <a href=#>gushed about having a husband who supported her</a> professional endeavors.</p><p>“He’s such a self-assured man, so sensible, so excited about my achievements, my dreams,” Chopra-Jonas said during an interview on the Discovery+ series Super Soul that same month. “Such a true partnership that he offers me in everything that we do together. I truly believe that my mom manifested him because that was her marriage.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In January 2022, the twosome<a href=#> announced the arrival of their first child together.</a></p><p>“We are overjoyed to confirm that we have welcomed a baby via surrogate,” they wrote in joint statements about their little one’s birth via Instagram at the time. “We respectfully ask for privacy during this special time as we focus on our family.
