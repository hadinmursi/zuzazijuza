It tasted just like a Whopper should taste.”</p><p>One “confused” customer who thought he was eating meat when he was actually chowing down on a veggie-filled alternative, even admitted the trick had led him to “re-evaluate my life.”</p><p>Unlike the beef-based traditional Whopper, the Impossible Whopper consists of a flame-grilled, plant-based patty topped with freshly sliced tomatoes, fresh lettuce, creamy mayonnaise, ketchup, crunchy pickles and sliced white onions on a toasted sesame seed bun.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>So how can you get your hands on this protein-packed alternative?
