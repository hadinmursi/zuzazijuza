Sky had previously dressed separately from the rest of the Knockouts at the last set of Impact Wrestling tapings in Bethlehem, PA. Sky dressing with the other Knockouts tonight prompted Kong to throw Sky’s bag out of the dressing room, and Sky then left, likely to go speak to a TNA official.</p><p>When Sky returned to the dressing room to get her belongings, <a href=#>Awesome Kong</a> reportedly went after her for “not apologizing”. As we reported, two different versions of what happened took place, with one version of the story claiming Kong unsuccessfully made a run at Sky, and the other claiming Kong grabbed Sky by the neck and assaulted her, causing Pat Kenney to intervene.</p><p>What could make matters worse for Kong, and her future in TNA, is that Reby Sky and Matt Hardy’s son Maxel was nearby during the incident, and Kong had been released from TNA once before back in 2010 after she assaulted Bubba the Love Sponge.</p><p>With regards to 2013, when the beef between Sky and Kong began, it all started when Reby Sky spoke out on Twitter about Sid Vicious no-showing an indy event. Sky’s comments lead to Kong ripping her and calling her a “ho” and a “peon” during a “YouShoot” interview, in a segment called “The Ho Bag.” Sky addressed Kong’s “YouShoot” remarks by Tweeting the following:</p><p>“Not aware of this, if it is true. Doesn’t make much sense, as I don’t know her on a really personal level & we have been nothing but nice to each other in passing at shows. We’ve actually texted back & forth a few times, so if she now has a problem with me, I can only attribute it to one thing/person. Fake as f–k to be nice to my face & talk s–t to a camera if its true, but no shocker there. That’s 99% of the women in this business anyway. Next.”</p><p>Sky also had the following to say in a September, 2013 Tweet aimed at Kong:</p><p>“I will NEVER respect a no-show; someone who scams promoters and f***s fans and people who actually show up to work. F*** outta here. That being said, go back to smiling to my face at shows and talking shit online [Kharma], you FAKEASS bitch.”</p><p>While not confirmed, it’s possible the above comments made by Sky are what Kong was claiming Sky did “not apologize” for at the Impact tapings tonight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpVxb3FxXaK8s7GMm5ico6OprqixjJ2crZmZocBuu81mq6GdXZbEpr%2FOppxmo5%2BjtG6%2BxJuwZqubrnqqusKim56mpGKxtr7Ip55mrJ%2Bjtqi006xkraaRYsGivMinnqxlmajAtrHSZpuarJVir6KvymarqGViZX50ecyoqZ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
