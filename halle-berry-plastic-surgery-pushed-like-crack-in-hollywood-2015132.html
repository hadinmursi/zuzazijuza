&#34;It is pressure,&#34; Berry, 48, confessed of plastic surgery. &#34;When you see everybody around you doing it, you have those moments when you think, 'To stay alive in this business, do I need to do the same thing?'&#34;
The Oscar-winning beauty admitted that she has personally been told to get work done."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Unlike some of her Hollywood peers, <strong><a href=#>Halle Berry</a></strong> told <a href=#>Yahoo! Beauty</a> on Friday, Feb. 13, that she's resisting the urge to go under the knife.</p><p>"It is pressure," Berry, 48, confessed of plastic surgery. "When you see everybody around you doing it, you have those moments when you think, 'To stay alive in this business, do I need to do the same thing?'"</p><p>The Oscar-winning beauty admitted that she has personally been told to get work done. "I won’t lie and tell you that those things don’t cross my mind," she continued, "because somebody is always suggesting it to me. 'You know if you just did a little bit of this and that, lift this up, then this would be a little bit better.' It’s almost like crack that people are trying to push on you. That’s what I feel like."</p><p>The mother of two offered advice to those struggling with similar surmounting pressure to preserve their youth.</p><p>"I just have kept reminding myself that beauty really is as beauty does, and it is not so much about my physical self," Berry reflected. "Aging is natural, and that’s going to happen to all of us. I think of those women that I thought aged so beautifully, like<strong> Lena Horn</strong>. Even how<strong> Jane Fonda </strong>is aging — I don’t know what she has or hasn’t done, but she looks beautiful as she’s going about her way. I just want to always look like myself, even if that’s an older version of myself. I think when you do too much of that cosmetic stuff, you become somebody else in a way."</p><p>Berry acknowledged, however, that accepting one's age is no cakewalk. "We have to stop wanting to look like that decade before," Berry told Yahoo! "We have to stop coveting that. Let it go and embrace it now and really be okay. It’s easy to say, I guess, but that’s the goal."</p><p>The A-lister's comments about aging and plastic surgery come at a timely junction, after one of Berry's fellow age 40-plus peers recently made headlines for her transformation. Uma Thurman became a trending topic worldwide this past week after sporting <a href=#>a shocking new look</a>&nbsp;on the red carpet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the Internet speculated about possible plastic surgery, Thurman <a href=#>brushed off the comments</a> on Thursday. "I know I look weird!" she said. "I guess nobody liked my makeup."</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: What do you think of Berry's comments?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX52urbjEZpmeqqKuerG4wKyroptdqMKzs8SrsGaopai1prCMpaCknV2Yv6Kvymagp2WYpLmtxdaopp1lYmV%2Bdn2Sa2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
