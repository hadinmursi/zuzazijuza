Eight years after her eponymous talk show ended its 19-year run, Raphael, 68, has finally explained why she chose — and stuck with — the famous, sometimes-ridiculed eyewear.

"So I saw an ad that said, 'We do a Pap smear and give you red glasses.'"</p><p>When Raphael visited the advertised medical office offering the bizarre deal, they tried to convince her to spring for a more expensive pair of frames.&nbsp; "They were going to trade me up [to a better pair]," she admitted on&nbsp; Oprah.&nbsp; "I said: 'You're not going to trade me up. I don't have that kind of money.' It's all they had for $19.95."</p><p>For her Oprah chat, Raphael appeared alongside fellow retired talk show greats<strong> Phil Donahue, Ricki Lake, Geraldo Rivera</strong> and <strong>Montel Williams</strong>; the group reminisced about their friendly rivalry with Winfrey and one another, and offered her advice on the impending end of her show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>How has Raphael spent her post-TV retirement? She's traveled the world and spent time on her 18th-century farm in New York state with her husband Karl and their chickens, cats and horses.</p><p>Despite that lovely life, Raphael admits to getting antsy without the daily grind of a talk show. "It was two weeks–great, I don't have to get up. And then it was seven years–why doesn't anybody call me?" she said. "So I'm doing a show now about a talk show host who is asked to leave the air and what happens to her after that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqapJyuequx0qywZqqRpbWisctmnLGonJa2r7%2BMoZyrZZaWurDB0mapnpxdnLmiv9KeqmZqYGZ9cnyQamY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
