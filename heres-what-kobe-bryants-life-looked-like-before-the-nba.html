During his rookie season, witnessing his NBA peers&nbsp;receive 30 plus minutes a game, while he&nbsp;rode the Laker's bench, there was immediate&nbsp;regret on Bryant's part: would college have been the better choice? But we all know how history unfolded:&nbsp;Bryant's obsessive work ethic and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan's mentorship</a> allowed him to become one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest two-guards in NBA history</a>.</p><p>Bryant's NBA journey is pretty well known at this point, so&nbsp;shifting a&nbsp;focus towards his childhood and adolescent years, here's a look at Kobe's early life prior to his NBA debut.</p><h2 id=life-in-italy><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Life In Italy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bryant-in-italy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe Bryant grew up idolizing Earl Monroe.

Refusing to adjust, Joe only played&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 seasons</a> in the NBA and chose to continue his basketball career overseas and play in the Italian league. Taking his wife and a 6-year-old Kobe with him, Kobe mastered the Italian language after living in the country for 7 years.</p><h2 id=a-growing-basketball-fanatic><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>A Growing Basketball Fanatic</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bryant-and-his-dad.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While residing in Italy, the Bryant family managed to move three times.

The only thing that remained consistent at that time was his love for basketball.
