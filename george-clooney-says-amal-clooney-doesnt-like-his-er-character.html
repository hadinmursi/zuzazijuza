George was a main cast member until 1999, <a href=#>when he left the show after five seasons</a>. Before the show’s 15th and final season wrapped, he returned to reprise his role 10 years after his exit.</p><p>In Monday’s interview, the Ocean’s 11 star detailed his transition from acting on TV to starring in films. He also explained why he has done more directing in recent years.</p><p>“When you’re doing television, you’re doing 22 hours a year … it’s, like, doing 11 movies,” he explained on the podcast. “You’re doing a lot of acting, and it’s fun to be involved. But, about 25 years ago, I just started looking at it [and] thinking, ‘I don’t want to worry about what some casting director thinks of how I’m aging.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/George-Clooneys-Wife-Amal-Clooney-Doesnt-Like-His-ER-Character.jpg><p>George also opened up about how enamored was with Amal when the pair first crossed paths, noting that <a href=#>she “took my breath away.”</a> The Oscar winner continued, “She was brilliant and funny and beautiful and kind. I was sort of swept off my feet. We got engaged after a few months and got married within the first year that we met. It surprised me more than probably anybody else in the world — and everybody else was pretty surprised.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>George and Amal <a href=#>tied the knot in 2014</a>.

My own, mostly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6ep6Kcsm6vy6imp52pYsCixdJmmKaZnGKwrbvOp5yyZZSksrS602ajoqOVYrWqv4yeqWabmJa%2Foq%2FTnqlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
