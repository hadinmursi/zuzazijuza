In the first years of our relationship, walking down the Champs-Élysées, people would react to him as to a major movie star.”</p><p>Fonda, who grew up under <a href=#>the Hollywood microscope</a> as the daughter of actor Henry Fonda, was rarely single.</p><p>Following her split from the French filmmaker in 1973, who helped put her on the map with 1968’s Barberella, the actress quickly remarried in 1973. Once that relationship fizzled out, the Georgia Rule actress again walked down the aisle in 1991.</p><p>It wasn’t until her eight-year-relationship with music producer <a href=#><strong>Richard Perry</strong></a>, however, that the actress had a sexually fulfilling romance.</p><p>“At 74, I’ve never had such a fulfilling sex life,” Jane said told <a href=#>The Sun</a> in July 2012. “The only thing I have never known is true intimacy with a man. I absolutely want to discover that before dying. It has happened with Richard, I feel totally secure with him. Often, when we make love, I see him as he was 30 years ago.”</p><p>Throughout her life, <a href=#>the Oscar winner</a> hasn’t been shy about sex and intimacy, nor has she shied away from revealing her Hollywood crushes.</p><p>After appearing <a href=#>alongside Robert Redford</a> in three films — and ahead of their 2017 reunion in Our Souls At Night — the activist opened up about their chemistry and the fact that she always loved him.</p><p>“I realize that I’ve grown up because in the three previous movies, <a href=#>I was always in love with him</a>,” Jane told <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> in March 2017. “I fell in love with him every time.”</p><p>In September 2020, the 9 to 5 star got real about <a href=#>the one that got away</a>, naming Marvin Gaye as her “great regret.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jane told <a href=#>The New York Times</a> that she missed her opportunity to sleep with the “Sexual Healing” crooner, because she was married at the time of his advances. “He wanted to and I didn’t,” she explained, noting she later learned that he had her picture on his refrigerator.</p><p>Scroll down to relive Jane’s romantic highlights.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6K6xGadqKaUlsBusMCtoKefXZ22tMDOq7Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
