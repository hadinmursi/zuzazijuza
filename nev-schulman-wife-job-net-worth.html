If any of you are a fan of the hit MTV series, then you know Nev takes relationships very seriously, so when it came time for him to fall for Laura, he didn't play around!</p><p>The star is quite vocal about his adoration for Laura, so much that his Instagram feed is practically a throne to their romance, which fans cannot get enough of! Although we know the two are madly in love, fans aren't so certain who Laura is outside of her role as a wife and mother of soon-to-be three!</p><p>Nev and Laura tied the knot back on July 22, 2017, in East Hampton, New York, which took place following their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14-month engagement!</a> In 2016, a year prior to saying their "I do's", Laura and Nev welcomed their first child together, Cleo James Schulman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This past June, the couple celebrated their 6 year wedding anniversary! Nev shared a post of the two, acting goofy like always, with nothing but a loving message for Laura. While Nev knows how to write a caption, Laura Perlongo is actually the professional writer when it comes to the two.</p><p>In 2019, the duo welcomed their second child, Beau, making them a family of four, however, that is set to change very soon! Earlier this year, Nev and Laura announced they were officially expecting their third child together, however, the journey hasn't been too easy. Laura has had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quite an emotional pregnancy</a>, and while her due date is only a month away, she's quite ready to give birth! "It's daunting!" Perlongo described the pregnancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Actually Happened To These Catfish Couples After The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-is-laura-perlongo-worth>How Much Is Laura Perlongo Worth?</h2><p>Prior to Laura becoming a mother and tying the knot with Nev Schulman, she worked as a freelance writer and photographer! It didn't take much time before she was branching out into the world of digital media, launching her very own Facebook series called We Need To Talk.</p><p>Laura and Nev both work on the series, where they use the platform to help "couples resolve relationship issues", the show description says. Perlongo has also gained some experience hosting alongside Nev on Catfish.
