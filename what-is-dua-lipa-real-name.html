The artist released three new singles last year, with more works currently in progress. She also works with partners to share weekly news entitled "Issue" on her Instagram page, sharing a mixture of current news, what she has been up to/experiencing, and other thoughts she deems worthy of including.</p><p>Aside from this work, Lipa has also been involved with the fashion shows that have started this year, most recently attending the Versace Fashion Week in Los Angeles on March 13th, 2023, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">with other big names</a> like Miley Cyrus, Anne Hathaway, and Paris Hilton also in attendance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-is-dua-lipa-originally-from>Where Is Dua Lipa Originally From?</h2><p>Dua Lipa was born in London on August 22, 1995, and she is the eldest child of Anesa and Dukagjin Lipa. The Lipas are originally Albanians from Kosovo, and Dua Lipa's maternal grandmother is Bosnian. The singer's two younger siblings are sister Rina, born in 2001, and brother Gjin, born in 2005.

In 2017, Lipa released her self-titled debut studio album, and ever since then she has been a staple in the pop music industry. As of this writing, Dua Lipa has numerous awards at home, including six Brit Awards, three Grammy Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, two Billboard Music Awards, and an American Music Award.</p><h2 id=is-dua-lipa-the-singer-39-s-real-name>Is Dua Lipa The Singer's Real Name?</h2><p>While many think that Dua Lipa is her stage name, it is actually the singer's real name. Her family name Lipa is Albanian, and her first name Dua means "love" in Albanian. However, the singer was not always proud of her unique name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Cheat Sheet, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dua Lipa used to be embarrassed by her name when she was younger</a>, presumably because she grew up in a country where she would not meet anyone with the same name. However, the singer has since grown to appreciate and love it — especially thanks to its uniqueness.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>One Of Dua Lipa's Hit Songs Became An Unexpected Fan Favorite...

"<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">A lot of people never really believe that my name really is Dua</a>," the singer said. "My parents are originally from Kosovo, and 'Dua' means love in Albanian. <strong>I guess growing up in London and going to school in London</strong>, I just wish I had a normal name. It kind of took me a while, especially growing up, to really appreciate my name. It was only when it kind of came to the point that I didn't really need a stage name was really when I, I really started enjoying it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While numerous pop stars like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry ended up using stage names, Dua Lipa decided she did not need one. Today, the singer proudly carries her unique name — and with that her Albanian heritage which the performer often speaks about. On Instagram, Dua Lipa revealed just how honored she is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">to bring the world's attention to Kosovo</a>.</p><p>"It’s an honor and a privilege to be able to represent my country all over the world and to continue my work and efforts globally to see that we leave our mark and make a difference," the singer wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Dua-Lipa-photoshoot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her name was mispronounced as "Dula Peep" by Wendy Williams during an episode of The Wendy Williams Show in 2018, Lipa's fans have embraced the mispronunciation as a nickname for the star. In an episode of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Lipa admitted that she is used to people not knowing how to say her name properly.</p><p>"I mean my whole life, I feel like, my name's always been a little bit difficult to pronounce," the singer told Jimmy Fallon. "I feel like I just wanted a normal name. I was like, 'Sarah, Hannah, Chloe, Anything, I'll take it.'"</p><p>In an interview with Elle, Dua Lipa once again spoke about the mispronunciation. "I've learned to correct people about my name my whole life. So I'm like, 'Call me whatever you want. You'll learn it soon enough, babes,'" the singer said. Several years after the release of her debut single, Dua Lipa is as popular as ever — and it is safe to say that everyone who keeps up with music these days has heard of the star's name (and knows how to pronounce it).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecOumGakmaWubr7EmqNmppGisnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
