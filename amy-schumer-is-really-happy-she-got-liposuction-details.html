It’s been a journey,” she captioned the post, thanking Dr. Seckin, her endocrinologist, for her surgery, and Dr. Jordan Terner, her plastic surgeon, for her liposuction. “Never thought I would do anything but talk to me after your uterus doesn’t contract for 2.5 years and you turn 40.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The I Feel Pretty actress’ candid approach to plastic surgery doesn’t stop and start with liposuction.

I used to be really judgmental about people getting work done,” she explained. “Now I’m like, do everything you can to love yourself exactly as you are, but once you turn 40 and have a C-section do whatever the f—k will make you feel best!”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a6unnSnJ%2BupZWneqq%2FjKucmqScrnqprc%2BpsGarmJp6qLvTZqOiqJ%2BowqTAyKilZpyVqa6quNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
