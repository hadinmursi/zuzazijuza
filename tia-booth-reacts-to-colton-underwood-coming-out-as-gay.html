While competing on <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a>’s season of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, Underwood shared that he and Booth <a href=#>had a connection prior to filming</a>. At the time, the Illinois State University alum shared that they’d spent “a weekend together” but the “timing wasn’t right.”</p><p>The former pair <a href=#>reflected on their split</a> in September 2018 after the episode aired.</p><p>“Never ever regret following your heart,” Booth wrote via Instagram at the time. “Things may not always work out as you planned, but they always work out as they should. Thankful that this chapter of our lives has ended so new chapters can begin. I truly wish you the best, C.”</p><p>Underwood, for his part, thanked the physical therapist for “teaching me even more about myself.”</p><p>“I know [our friendship] will continue far beyond Paradise,” he wrote. “Don’t settle for anything less than the world, because that’s what you deserve. Can’t wait to see what the future has in store for you and catch up on life someday, preferably over a hot dog dinner.”</p><p>The NFL alum went on to star on his own season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> in 2019. Though he didn’t get engaged, he began dating winner <a href=#><strong>Cassie Randolph</strong></a> until they <a href=#>split in May 2020</a>.</p><p>Underwood revealed he was gay during a conversation with <a href=#><strong>Robin Roberts</strong></a> on Good Morning America, which aired on Wednesday. During the interview, he also <a href=#>reflected on filming the Bachelor franchise</a>.</p><p>“Do I regret being the Bachelor? Do I regret handling it the way that I did? I do think I could have handled it better, I’ll say that,” he shared. “I just wish I wouldn’t have dragged people into my own mess of figuring out who I was. I genuinely mean that.”</p><p>The Colton Underwood Legacy Foundation founder went on to give his thanks — and offer an apology — to the Bachelor stars, including Booth, who helped him come to terms with himself.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“At the same time, I can sit here and say I’m sorry to all of those women, I can also say thank you,” Underwood said. “Without them and without the Bachelor franchise, I don’t know if this would have ever came out.”</p><p><strong>Us editors discuss Colton Underwood’s coming out in this Here for the Right Reasons podcast highlight!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZFir7C706Fkq52RmMG0edOoZJynnKm8r3nUp5ueqqekvKV5wqikoqaXYry2wIyaqmafka58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
