I didn’t have flu-like symptoms, I didn’t have shortness of breath, I didn’t have difficulty breathing, I didn’t have a cough, I didn’t have a low-grade fever. I still don’t have a fever. I didn’t have a loss of smell or taste, apparently, I just lost consciousness.”</p><p>He added, “So, in addition to all the other stuff you have to look out for, pass out in the middle of a show, on stage, you probably need to get tested.”</p><p>The Soul Plane star concluded by thanking his fans for their support. “Well thank you for your prayers and your well-wishes and a few more of them wouldn’t hurt, so hopefully I won’t develop symptoms. Maybe this is as bad as it gets,” he said.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hughley lost consciousness </a>while performing at Zanies Comedy Club on Friday, June 19, and was later hospitalized. An audience member shared footage via Twitter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">of the Hughleys alum</a> slumping to the floor before two men carried him off stage.</p><p>“He was suffering from exhaustion after all the week’s work and travel and was kept overnight at the hospital for tests under doctor’s orders. He is awake and feeling better, and wishes to thank everyone for the very kind prayer and thoughts,” Hughley’s representative told Us Weekly on Saturday. Two days later, the rep told Us that the comedian “took private medical transportation from Nashville and is quarantining comfortably back home.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dancing With the Stars alum</a> was performing at Zanies Comedy Club as part of a four-night residency.
