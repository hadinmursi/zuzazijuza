The star in the making was a much different competitor when she debuted in the Mae Young Classic, as she admitted in a recent interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Yahoo!</a> “I wasn’t confident in myself at the first Mae Young Classic because I wasn’t being myself. I went out there and was trying to please everyone, be what they thought I should be. I was trying to make everyone happy, but it wasn’t making me happy at all.”</p><p></p><p>She also wasn’t used to the scale of professional wrestling stateside versus the local market in her native Australia.</p><p>I guess wrestling isn’t as big in other countries as it is here, especially Australia,” Ripley said. “When I went to NXT UK and I was part of the women’s championship tournament, I saw all of those people and I was absolutely floored. I had never wrestled in front of that many people before. At home, I think the largest crowd I ever wrestled was in front of 500 people. To go from that to all of this now, there are so many people watching you and trying to enjoy the show, I think ‘Man, I’ve got to give people what they’ve paid for. Let’s go.’</p><p>Rhea also talked at length about her amazing month leading up to both Survivor Series and TakeOver: WarGames. In particular, she was excited to step into the double cage. “WarGames was a match that I’ve dreamt of my entire life. I’ve always wanted to have a match where I get to use weapons and I never got that back home. That was my first time being able to use all of that stuff in a match — legally. We put on a match that no one expected from us and helped prove why NXT is the main roster.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBubmtrZ2K%2FqbHAZqmiqJyaxm6x16mjmqGeqHqktMCnnp6cXZ67qsDImqNmpJ%2BkuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
