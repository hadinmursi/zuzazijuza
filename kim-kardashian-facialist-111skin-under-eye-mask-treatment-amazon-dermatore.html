Happy shopping!</p><p>Let’s be honest: The way that celebrities are social distancing is a little bit different than the rest of Us! But even if we lack sumptuous swimming pools and manicured acres of land, we all share one thing in common — our daily routines have definitely been disrupted. If you’re used to getting a weekly manicure or having your roots touched up at the salon, that’s just not happening right now. These days, it’s all about DIY when it comes to personal maintenance.</p><p>The same is obviously true for skincare! Luckily, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kim Kardashian’s</strong></a> facialist was kind enough to send over some high-end products that the reality TV star can use in lieu of her regular appointments. The care package included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">these under-eye masks</a> that are perfect for de-puffing, brightening and fighting signs of fatigue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/111SKIN-Sub-Zero-De-Puffing-Eye-Mask.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">111SKIN Sub-Zero De-Puffing Eye Mask – 8 count</a> (originally $90) on sale with free shipping for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$82</a> at Amazon, also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dermstore</a>!</strong> <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><strong>Get it as soon as April 27, 2020.

Czech’s other A-list clients have included <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong>, <strong>Lily Aldridge</strong>, <strong>Candice Swanepoel</strong> and countless others. With so many stars cosigning her services, we know that these product recommendations are the real deal!</p><p>The ultra-pampering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">masks from 111SKIN</a> quickly improve signs of aging, which gives your complexion a more youthful look. The formula consists of coenzyme q10 and peptides that help effectively target these issues and decrease dark circles and other common problems that occur in the under-eye area. These <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">gel masks</a> also help limit the breakdown of collagen, which can lead to a loss of elasticity in the skin as well as sagging.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kim-Kardashian-111SKIN-Sub-Zero-De-Puffing-Eye-Mask.png><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">111SKIN Sub-Zero De-Puffing Eye Mask – 8 count</a> (originally $90) on sale with free shipping for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$82</a> at Amazon, also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dermstore</a>!</strong> <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><strong>Get it as soon as April 27, 2020.
