Lilly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hasn't always made headlines</a> for the right reasons, and she certainly made headlines when she talked about her disdain for her own character from Lost.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the actress, and learn about why she disliked her character from Lost.</p><h2 id=evangeline-lilly-has-had-a-successful-career>Evangeline Lilly Has Had A Successful Career</h2><p>Since making her professional debut in acting during the early part of the 2000s, Evangeline Lilly is someone who has been steadily chipping away at what has amounted to a successful career in entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lilly was landing film and television work early on, and she appeared in some notable projects that she didn't even get a lot of credit for. These projects include The Lizzie McGuire Movie, Freddy vs. Jason, and even White Chicks. This, of course, changed once she became a breakout star.</p><p>These days, the actress is playing Hope van Dyne in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and she has appeared in several films within the franchise. She is slated to start in 2023 is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a>, and fans cannot wait to see her back in action as the Wasp.</p><p>Lilly's had an amazing ride, and it all started thanks to a hit TV show that millions of people were sucked into.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sophie Turner Slams Evangeline Lilly's Lack Of Concern About COVID-19</a></span></p><h2 id=she-played-kate-austen-on-39-lost-39>She Played Kate Austen On 'Lost'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2004, Lost became the biggest show on TV, and it was an instant success that launched the careers of several notable performers, including Evangeline Lilly.</p><p>Lilly was cast as survivor Kate Austen on the show, and the crazy thing about her getting the gig is the fact that she wasn't all that interested in being an actress at the time.</p><p>When dishing on landing the role, the actress said, "I would say it was my destiny, because it certainly wasn't my agenda. I was one of those very rare, rare actresses who wasn't trying to be an actress when I got that job."</p><p>Despite this, the actress decided to roll the dice on something that she had a lot of faith in.</p><p>"And the only reason why I took the job at the time was because I had enormous faith, and I really believed that everything in my life just continued to sort of push and prod me and point me towards this thing. Then it happened so quickly—it happened so easily!—that it felt like destiny," she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lilly might have appeared in over 100 episodes of the show, but she grew to hate the character that she was playing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Evangeline Lilly Changes Her Tone Regarding COVID-19</a></span></p><h2 id=evangeline-lilly-found-her-character-to-be-obnoxious>Evangeline Lilly Found Her Character To Be Obnoxious</h2><p>So, why did Evangeline Lilly grow to hate her character? Unfortunately, the actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">found her character to be obnoxious</a>.</p><p>"At the beginning, she was kind of cool. And then as the show went on, I felt like she became more and more predictable and obnoxious. I felt like my character went from being autonomous—really having her own story and her own journey and her own agendas—to chasing to men around the island. And that irritated the s--- out of me," Lilly said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lack of change in the character was something that Lilly found frustrating, and the character's lack of autonomy was an annoyance, too.</p><p>"I did throw scripts across rooms when I'd read them. Because I would get very frustrated by the diminishing amount of autonomy she had and the diminishing amount of her own story there was to play."</p><p>Lilly stated that she tried her best with what she was given, but this clearly did little to help ease any frustration that she was feeling.</p><p>"I wanted her to be better, because she was an icon for strength and autonomy for women, and I thought we could have done better than that. I think we did well. I think I tried very, very hard to take what I was given and always find the way to shower her strength, find the way to have her own thoughts and opinions and ideas, and to take moments that I thought might be a bit whiny and somehow make them not whiny," the actress said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Evangeline Lilly And Jason Sudeikis' Relationship</a></span></p><p>Evangeline Lilly might have hated her character on Lost, but the show turned her into a household name and launched her career, so there's some give and take there.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Which MCU Actor Has A Higher Net Worth: Brie Larson Or Evangeline Lilly?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnK%2BZnpyyrbXNnmSloZyhxm60wK2cnWWYmr9ur8eaqZqbpJq%2FbrLRqKRmpJ%2BowXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
