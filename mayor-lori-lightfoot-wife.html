You want certain things for yourself, and falling in love and having a family and doing all those things felt important to us.”</strong></p><p>The Mayor who opened the doors for thousands of others to follow walked through the doors of City Hall the last time on May 12th as her term as Chicago’s Mayor came to an end.&nbsp;</p><p>City’s 56th mayor bid goodbye to her fifth-floor office at the City Hall after serving a four-year long term.&nbsp;</p><p>Mayor Lori’s mayoral term could be termed both historic and turbulent.

She mentioned that hope directs one in the right direction and makes one resilient and motivated.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, she also offered the elected Mayor, Brandon Johnson, a word of advice. She told him to be the Mayor of the entire city and ensure his efforts were distributed equally amongst the citizens of Chicago.&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, she mentioned that even after formally retiring, her door will always remain open for the new Mayor, and she will be available for help whenever Johnson needs it.&nbsp;</p><p>After defying the odds all her life, the Mayor deserved an exit that would go down in history. Mayor Lori Lightfoot wife, Amy Eshleman, accompanied her at the time, and the two went off in style in a 1940 Cadillac.</p><p><strong>You may also read:</strong> <a href=#>Carl Edwards Wife, Katherine Downey: The Dynamic Force In His Life</a></p><p><strong>“Bye everybody!
