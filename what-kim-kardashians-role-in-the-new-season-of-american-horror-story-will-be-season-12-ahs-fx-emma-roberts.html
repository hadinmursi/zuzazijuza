With everything that is going on in each episode, the themes vary from season to season. Season 11 was subtitled as American Horror Story: NYC, since it focused on the city of New York as a subplot/character.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 12 will be titled American Horror Story: Delicate</a>. It will be the first season of the show that takes heavy inspiration from an outside source: the novel Delicate Condition by author Danielle Valentine. The book was published in August 2022, following a storyline of great thrill, suspense, and suspect.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think This Is The Worst Season Of American Horror Story</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-is-joining-the-ahs-family><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Is Joining The AHS Family</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-10.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian is taking a big step taking on a roll in American Horror Story, despite her previous experience in Hollywood.

The writer, Halley Feiffer, and the rest of the team began speaking with the reality star "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last summer about crafting a unique role</a> for her scripted TV debut." This likely means Kardashian will either play a villain or an intense antiheroine.</p><h2 id=who-else-is-joining-the-ahs-season-12-cast-list><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Who Else Is Joining The AHS Season 12 Cast List?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/B30561BF-02A1-48FB-99B6-15BC1C413598.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian is a big name, but she is not the only one to be joining the cast list for season 12.
