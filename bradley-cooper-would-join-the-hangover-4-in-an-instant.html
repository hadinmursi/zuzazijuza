“I would probably do Hangover 4 in an instant, yeah,” Cooper, 48, said during “The New Yorker Radio Hour” while promoting his new movie Maestro. “Just because I love Todd [Phillips], I love Zach [Galifianakis], I love Ed [Helms] so much, I probably would.”
When pressed about whether or not that’s coming, Cooper admitted, “I don’t think Todd’s ever going to do that."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There’s a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet and the groom (<strong>Justin Bartha</strong>) is nowhere to be found. The guys have to go on a wild goose chase to ensure their pal is safe and makes it to the altar.</p><p>The 2009 film grossed $469.3 million worldwide. The Hangover Part II, which was released in 2011, earned $586.8 million, and The Hangover Part III finished the trilogy in 2013 with $362 million.</p><p>Helms and Galifianakis reunited in the October 2021 animated flick Ron’s Gone Wrong. At the premiere, Galifianakis said that he didn’t expect a fourth film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bradley-Cooper-Says-He-Would-Sign-on-for-The-Hangover-4-In-an-Instant-But-Doesnt-Think-It-Will-Ever-Happen-01.jpg><p>“Maybe if they made it a Pixar version … a really nice, family-friendly version of it,” he quipped of a potential sequel while speaking to <a href=#>Extra</a> before adding, “I don’t know, I don’t think anybody’s thinking about that.”</p><p>Galifianakis added that although he isn’t a big texter, the cast has a group chat. “We like to reminisce when we talk about it,” he said.</p><p>During Cooper’s interview with “The New Yorker Radio Hour,” he was asked if he was done with comedic movies like The Hangover. His current film, <a href=#>Maestro</a>, is a dramatic biopic while 2018’s A Star Is Born was a tragedy. He starred and directed in both movies.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You said the word ‘fun’ … There’s nothing more fun that I’ve experienced than Maestro and A Star is Born. This is me having fun,” Cooper said. “I wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t.”</p><p>He noted that of course dedicating <a href=#>years of his life</a> to each project limits how many times he can truly throw himself into a project. “If I’m lucky enough to have another idea come in that I’m willing to exert this much energy, if I could do it two more, three more times in my life, I’d be very lucky,” Cooper said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmrmZShsrp5wqimqZ2iYsSwwcudZKOnmaN6tbTEZp%2Bappekw6a%2BjG1koqZdlrtutc2sq5qmpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
