Robb, Is She Married |&nbsp; Is Natalie Robb in a relationship?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Natalie J. Robb, who won 2017’s Sexiest Female title at the ‘Inside Soap Awards’ is single, and that definitely might come forth as surprising news. However, the people, who fantasize her to be their love, might be happy knowing about her not dating anyone.<br>Robb is very vocal about what she wants in life and when. Back in October 2017, she stated the reason behind her not dating;</p><p>“I have no time to date anyway. I would rather wait for the right person to come along, I’m not in a hurry. I am definitely not on Tinder or anything like that. Oh my goodness, no. Could you imagine Mucky Moira popping up on someone’s phone? Nothing against other people who want to do that, but I’ll wait for the right person to come along.”</p><p>Robb went further to say, “I don’t know whether it is with social media now, but the dating scene and apps like Tinder have stopped people going out to meet as much as they used to do. I would rather meet someone, by the way, fate bringing us together.”</p><p>Also, she provided a slight hint that after being done with the big storylines that she is a part of, she might get into the dating. However, we also came to know that Bronson, her dog is her big love, as of now.</p><p>“Bronson is my big love at the moment, I don’t have time to date as I live on set! Maybe I’ll get back into it once I’ve finished with these big storylines. If I went for dinner I’d have to say, ‘Do you mind if I bring my script with me, so I can learn my lines?’”</p><p>Robb, who is all about waiting for the things to fall into place by itself also once shared her thoughts on the wedding, back in 2014. In the context of her character, Moria from Emmerdale getting married, Robb expressed that her wedding will not be big, but it will undoubtedly be beautiful,</p><p>“For Moira and Cain it’s the whole traditional thing but that isn’t for me. It wouldn’t be a big, white wedding – I’d want to do something simple but beautiful. Not that I’m in any rush to get married. In real life, it’s never really been a big thing for me.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=natalie-j-robb-photos></span><span>Natalie J.
