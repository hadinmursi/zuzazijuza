The lights were on, and I was naked.”</p><p>In a statement to The Daily Beast, Scotland Yard said, “Officers from the Met’s Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command are investigating an allegation of rape. The allegation was reported to police on 17 November 2016 by a woman who alleged she was raped at an address in Chelsea in June or July 2004 when she was aged 21. There have been no arrests at this stage and enquiries continue.”</p><p>Police have also asked Blaine to come to the U.K. for an “interview under caution” so that he can be provided with more information about the allegations, according to emails reviewed by the outlet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The illusionist’s attorney Marty Singer has denied Prince’s accusations. “My client vehemently denies that he raped or sexually assaulted any woman, ever, and he specifically denies raping a woman in 2004,” Singer said in a statement to Us Weekly. “If, in fact, there is any police investigation, my client will fully cooperate because he has nothing to hide.”</p><p>Blaine briefly spoke to The Daily Beast via phone in the wake of the allegations, saying, “Wow… there’s absolutely nothing… that’s crazy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmaaesW6uy5qgp51dlrCkwdKem2anlmK%2ForzEZpmyZZakv66x0WakqJyVoXqvrdOaqqGZXaW%2FqrrCnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
