Flair, who is now 74 years old, appeared on <a href=#>Insight With Chris Van Vliet</a> to further discuss his desire to wrestle again sometime.</p><p>“I want to wrestle again right now. Isn’t it crazy? I feel like because, <a href=#>Ricky Morton</a>, the guy that I should have chosen for my last match would have been great,” Flair said. “Ricky Morton is still wrestling. You know what the best thing for me about it was, is I forced myself to really get in shape. I’ve heard this from guys over the years. When they were older, I was in my prime. The older guys would say, ‘Man, I’m tired of working out.'”</p><p>“There gets a time when you just get bored working out. You don’t have a goal. I mean, they gave me a goal and I just attacked it. I didn’t stop drinking or anything but I was training literally training three hours a day, five days a week in the ring, or I was doing the sled, the ropes. Yeah, I got my bench press up for two and a quarter. I mean, so from being dead to all that was pretty cool.”</p><h3 id=h-ric-flair-s-last-match>Ric Flair’s ‘Last Match’</h3><p>Looking back on his “last match,” Flair recalled feeling mixed emotions heading into it. While Flair was obviously excited to step back into the ring, he later experienced a sensation of light-headedness, which affected his performance.</p><p>“Everything went great, including the 9,000 people we packed in there which was more than WCW or WWE had had in the building forever. And then I just walked on the ramp and I just [felt] a combination [of emotions]. I guess I’d be nervous and everything started out fine though. So I don’t know why I got lightheaded for a second. I made the mistake of saying to one of the guys I don’t feel so good,” Flair said.</p><p>“Well, they all went [with it]. They all thought I was telling them like my heart or something like that. And that’s the worst thing I did and then I got real lightheaded. And I know that I was in and out all during the match.”</p><p>Flair went on to describe how he kept himself afloat throughout the match, and then afterwards.</p><p>“I was fighting like hell to get through it, but it was just fighting here. Nothing that I felt, I wasn’t hurting anywhere. I just felt bad because the guys had been all panicking and worried about my health. We had said we had constructed such a great match. If it had come off the way we’ve practised forever, it would have been a masterpiece, but, when I walked back to the locker room,[Undertaker] made me drink three Gatorades. Then I went to Kid Rock and drank all night long.”</p><h2 id=h-changes-to-the-match>Changes To The Match</h2><p>Though the participants had practiced the match ahead of time, Flair revealed there were some spots that ultimately got nixed.</p><p>“Oh God. They were just gonna slam me off the top, suplex me, stuff on the floor. Everybody’s just panicked. It all was a concern for me, they didn’t forget their parts. They just [went], ‘Let’s get through this.’ That’s why I had to<a href=#> fake that heart attack. </a>I went slow down, slow down, I’m okay. Should have never said anything. So then we got a little bit more back in. But my son-in-law [Andrade] had to put the brass knucks on my hand. He’s going, Wake up sir. That was it.”</p><p><a href=#>Ric Flair Reveals How He Came Up With His Iconic ‘Rolex-Wearing…’ Promo</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqaG1xYWK%2Fqq%2BMn6OaoaJixKK606xkraddrL%2Bmv9OlnGaZl5a2r3nSoaaupJSrsm68yJyinpxdp7akt9hmpKiqpKS7brLOq2ShoaNiuaK%2F02akmqyTnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
