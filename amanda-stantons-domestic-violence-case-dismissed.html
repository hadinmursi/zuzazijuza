When the group believed the Bachelor in Paradise star to be asleep, they left … only for the two to begin fighting again.</p><p>He went on to allege that Stanton “swung” the hotel phone at him, which hit him, and claimed he held her down to stop her from hitting him as the reality star “continued to scratch and pinch” him on his “arms and body.”</p><p>The TV personality, for her part, claimed in the paperwork that she was pinching him “to get free” after he pinned her down on the bed. She alleged she later got free and “was able to lock herself in the bathroom.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Stanton’s rep released a statement to Us Weekly following the incident that read: “Amanda continues to be embarrassed by her behavior and greatly regrets the incident ever occurred.
