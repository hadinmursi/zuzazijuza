We are all about pretty activewear. What, just because we’re getting a little sweaty we can’t look chic? We firmly believe that the more stylish our activewear is, the better we’ll perform during our actual workout. We’ll be more motivated to work out too. And hey, we don’t have to only wear it to the gym."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What, just because we’re getting a little sweaty we can’t look chic? We firmly believe that the more stylish our activewear is, the better we’ll perform during our actual workout. We’ll be more motivated to work out too. And hey, we don’t have to only wear it to the gym. Athleisure is the trend right now, and we’re taking full advantage of it!</p><p>The latest piece of activewear to catch our eye, leaving us staring ever since, is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a sports bra from Alo</a>, a top-of-the-line yoga brand. We actually spotted it on social media though, casually modeled by the one and only <strong>Lady Gaga</strong>! The “Rain On Me” singer just recently posted a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gorgeous photo</a> on Instagram, her platinum hair hanging down and peeking into the sunshine and her makeup positively glowing. It was an ad for the Tudor watch on her wrist, but we have to say, we were immediately drawn to her Alo sports bra instead. She also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">posted a photo</a> in a pink shade just a few weeks ago!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Glitter Bra</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$62</a> at Alo with free shipping! Check out the matching shorts <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</strong></p><p>In the more recent photo, Gaga wore the Marina/Silver shade of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this bra</a>, a pretty, periwinkle blue with silver threads that shimmer and sparkle with your every movement. This isn’t the type of glitter that’s going to shed everywhere or irritate your skin. It’s integrated into the four-way stretch fabric itself, allowing for comfortable movement, whether you’re practicing yoga or going for a run outside. You’ll be glistening throughout any type of workout — and not just from the sweat!</p><p>When we say sweat, by the way, we mean just what’s on your exposed skin. The fabric itself is actually moisture-wicking and antimicrobial, made to deter any funky sweat stains and uncomfortable pooling. We can trust that it’ll do its job well too, since it was wear-tested by Alo’s very own in-house team. You can see why this brand is so popular among celebrities!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Glitter Bra</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$62</a> at Alo with free shipping! Check out the matching shorts <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</strong></p><p>This bra has a scoop neckline and a low back, with thin shoulder straps and light to medium support. Shoppers say it’s easily “supportive enough for yoga” and that it’s “one of the most comfortable sports bras [they’ve] ever worn.” They’ve even “stopped buying from Lululemon” because of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alo pieces like this</a>! Shoppers are so dedicated that one even said 80% of their closet was now Alo. We guess that’s just what happens when a brand constantly produces “high quality and flattering” pieces!</p><p>Apart from the Marina shade, your other choices are Black, Bone and Macaron Pink, as seen in Gaga’s selfie. They all have that same glorious silver sparkle too.
