It's never a surprise to see the two together at events or working on a project. Additionally, the comedic duo is often seen in interviews or on their podcast, sharing jokes and funny stories. All of these have come to be expected by the fans, who love the camaraderie the two share.</p><p>However, in May 2013, photos began circulating that brought confusion to people everywhere. What was in the images that caused so many people to question the actor's intentions?</p><h2 id=paparazzi-caught-jason-bateman-and-will-arnett-holding-hands>Paparazzi Caught Jason Bateman And Will Arnett Holding Hands</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-2023-10-09-at-9-05-58-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many photos of both Jason Bateman and Will Arnett where they are laughing or engaging in a joke. These are often paired with a multitude of interviews in which they poke fun at each other and reveal embarrassing stories. However, the photo series that filled people's screens in May 2013 deviated from the usual images that fans are used to seeing.</p><p>In a set of photographs, the paparazzi caught the stars walking down a sidewalk in New York City, holding hands. Within some of the images, you can see the actors staring into each other's eyes. Additional photos capture Jason Bateman pointing at an object off in the distance with Will following his gaze.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jason-bateman-in-an-interview-with-today.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jason Bateman Lost His Cool While Prepping For An Interview (And Regretted It Later)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jason Bateman was prepping for an interview when he lost his temper, embarrassing himself and making a mystery guest feel awkward.</span><p>While it's unknown where the two were coming from, going to, or what they were doing, fans have their fair share of speculations. Some think they could be coming from their joint office, where they conduct business for their digital production company DumbDumb, or perhaps coming from or going to <a href=#>a recording session of their podcast SmartLess (with Sean Hayes)</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whatever the destination or purpose, the two looked to be enjoying themselves in the beautiful weather.</p><p>However, Will and Jason were caught on their leisurely stroll at the same time as when the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluth Frozen Banana Stand</a> appeared in Times Square. Were the two grabbing a frozen banana to commemorate the return of their hit show Arrested Development?</p><p>Some speculate that they were helping to run the operation. However, there didn't appear to be any celebrity sightings of them punching the clock and slinging banana treats.</p><h2 id=will-arnett-offers-one-explanation>Will Arnett Offers One Explanation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-2023-10-09-at-6-58-18-pm.png><p>There are <a href=#>many things that fans know</a> about Will Arnett due to his years in the public eye.

While he, Jason, is okay with the public being aware of their relationship, Will is a bit more reserved in divulging the information.</p><p>Jason continues to say that even though Will is trying to play the situation off as a one-time prank, the two are actually taking a serious step towards cementing their status as a couple in the pictures. Referencing the image in which Jason is pointing at something in the distance, the actor says he is pointing out a new place for them to live together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In other words, the two were embarking on a real estate search to start their new lives together. He ended the explanation with a greeting to Arnett, calling him "honey."</p><p>Which side of the story is the correct version of events? Although Jason and Will have different versions, one thing is for sure. The two actors and comedians know how to enjoy life and keep their fans laughing while enjoying their friendship at every given chance, which is a nice change from all the seriousness in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrLKzsYywoKWkXZa%2Fr7HTrWSappRit6K%2Fzqdkm5mkmrqiuoyhpqWcmaO0brTAp5usZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
