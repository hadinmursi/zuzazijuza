I have nothing to do with their divorce and I am not dating Jay Cutler,” she said during an interview with <a href=#>famed divorce attorney <strong>Laura Wasser</strong></a> on the “All’s Fair” podcast, an iHeartRadio Original. “I’ve been in a relationship for quite some time now. He is a very private person and I respect that. You know, him and his kids are a huge part of my life now, but I try to keep them out of the public part of my life because it’s not what they signed up for.”</p><p>Henderson and the Uncommon James founder were once inseparable, but the pals <a href=#>recently had a falling out</a> over rumors that the celebrity stylist was having an affair with Cutler. During the last season of Very Cavallari, the reality TV personality claimed that Henderson was <a href=#>using their friendship for fame</a>.</p><p>“The whole time, her whole thing has been like, ‘I don’t care about the show. I only care about your friendship,'” Cavallari recalled. “She drank the Kool-Aid, big time. I thought Kelly was the last person on the planet that this would ever happen with.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Even in light of her former friend’s complicated divorce, Henderson admitted on the podcast that she wasn’t “really in touch” with either Cavallari or her <a href=#>estranged husband</a> anymore. “I’ve kind of gotten some space from both of them,” she explained.</p><p>The former Chicago Bears player <a href=#>shares three children</a> with Cavallari: Camden, 7, Jaxon, 5, and Saylor, 4. In paperwork obtained by Us Weekly, the reality star accused Cutler of “inappropriate marital conduct” and alleged that leaving her kids in Cutler’s care would <a href=#>cause “irreparable harm.”</a> He has yet to comment publicly on Cavallari’s claims.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyYr5mcoa6ztdJmnLFlkpuzbrfEpaOyZZiau6Wx0aymp2WUmruqsdJmoZqxXZjCtbjEq2SanpaWtrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
