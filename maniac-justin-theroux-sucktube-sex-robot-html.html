Mantleray’s toupee was born out of a wig-fitting for a hairpiece that looked way too much like an actual wig —&nbsp;“It was so bad I thought, Wouldn’t it be funny and good for the character if we just played it as an actual wig?” —&nbsp;and his glasses were chosen to match the wire frames worn by his colleague Dr. Fujita (Sonoya Mizuno), as the two are “supposed to be a reflection of each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/7eb/426/7c79a6c2eebbf1ae0e487b373eb8f1784f-20-justin-theroux.rsquare.w400.jpg> Justin Theroux and Sonoya Mizuno twinning in Maniac.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmc3jt6n00253a62nj9468a3@published data-word-count=92>At various points throughout the series, Mantleray appears in instructional videos for <a href=#>Neberdine Pharmaceutical and Biotech</a>, the company conducting the experimental drug trial. For those, Theroux deployed a deliberately awkward speaking voice, and requested a teleprompter so it felt like he was, well, reading his lines off of teleprompter. His first work on Maniac was actually shooting those goofy scenes, but “as we found the character and the voice and the attitude,” he says, “we ended up having to go back and reshoot the instructional videos because it wasn’t the same guy.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmc3jt5r00243a628fuozsys@published data-word-count=85>As Maniac goes on, it becomes clear that Mantleray’s anxieties developed thanks to his toxic relationship with his mother, Greta (Sally Field), a famed, insufferable pop-psychologist who represents everything that he opposes. “When I first met her, she immediately launched into our backstory,” Theroux said of working with Field. “How I was probably too coddled … I probably slept in bed with her until I was far too old to be sleeping in bed with her. She really likes to go deep on that stuff.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmc3jt5o00223a62bvdumwfh@published data-word-count=104>Nearly all of Mantleray’s anxieties on are display in Theroux’s first big scene in the third episode, where Dr. Fujita interrupts some virtual-reality sex he’s having with a blow-job robot referred to as the “Sucktube.” (His Oculus-like VR headset is called a “Suckulus.”) In his fantasy, Mantleray has giant, anime-style hair, which Theroux credited to the character “trying to assimilate” into his Japanese company’s corporate culture — and, of course, his great anxiety about his baldness. Once Fujita makes her presence known in Mantleray’s slobby apartment, the robot hangs against his pelvis as they carry out serious conversation about a former colleague’s sudden death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/29e/a00/1bd73b98eb9ff4ea9642cd424dfee03bb7-21-justin-theroux-sonya.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/711/b59/fc9f63d9c48b08ee26795e334227f8644d-21-justin-theroux-inside-the-sucktube.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> The Sucktube in action. <span class=credit>Photo: Netflix.</span> <span class=full>The Sucktube in action. <span class=credit>Photo: Netflix.</span></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmc3jt7000263a62jvlndfyw@published data-word-count=78>According to Somerville and Fukunaga, the idea of a fantasy sex experience came from writer Mauricio Katz, who heard a woman talking about erotic fantasies about Atlantis. Then, Maniac’s specialty props designer Steven Brower built the actual Sucktube device, while the writers had to clear the name itself to make sure some actual company hadn’t branded it. “Sucktube was the easiest thing to clear,” Somerville said. “We just thought we should get the name now, too,” Fukunaga added.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjmc3jt5p00233a6296lipei9@published data-word-count=70>The Sucktube continues a trend of dick jokes about Theroux’s TV characters, after the third season of The Leftovers included a scene where <a href=#>his penis unlocked a door</a>. But that’s just a coincidence, he insists. “It wouldn’t be a Justin Theroux vehicle if it didn’t have some sort of …” He trails off. “No, it was one of those things. All of this was just so wildly different and insane.”</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjm8mcxzi005ovpyeoanuh265@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Maniac Is a Hell of a Drug</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjman0iwa007dd2ye1wbm3wa3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline></span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>How Justin Theroux’s Maniac Character Got His Blow-Job Robot</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocWdgbnyurc2imJxlmqrAtbXNZquhnaKkwrl50q6apKyll7Juv8SxZKunkqTBb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
