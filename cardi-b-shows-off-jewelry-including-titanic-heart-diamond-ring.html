As if that weren’t enough, two of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">extra-long claw-like nails</a> are also sporting shimmery rhinestones that catch the light as beautifully as her jewelry.</p><p>All the pieces seen on her left hand happen to be from her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Offset</strong></a>. The pear-shaped diamond bauble is an 8-carat engagement ring from Pristine Jewelers, while the blinged-out watch was a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> for <a href=#>Mother’s Day</a> this year (along with two new Birkin bags). As for the heart-shaped stone, it’s a brand new addition that was a 27th birthday present.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cardi-B-Bling-02.jpg><p>In an Instagram video she posted to her feed on Friday, October 11, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy Award</a>-winning artist is presented with a tray covered in rose petals. However, it’s the two sparkly bands that catch everyone’s attention. The “Bodak Yellow” singer even wept tears of joy when they were unveiled (a regular occurrence when she’s given beautiful jewelry).</p><p>“Thank you sooo much babe @offsetyrn I can’t believe it,” she wrote in the accompanying caption. “I’m so happy. Soo grateful.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>This two-part set is from the same company that created her engagement ring. Along with the separate interlocking bands, the stone’s shape also stands out seeing as it’s based on the infamous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Titanic diamond</a>. This eye-catching gem sits in a three-prong pavé set that’s completely made up of even smaller heart-shaped diamonds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5ius7DIZplmq5ikxLR5zp%2BdZqKVrLKtvthmoKebnKqxqrrGZquirJGjtqR5x56Yq6xdmbaiuc6nm2aqmaO0cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
