I’m very abrasive and I have a lot of energy and passion in everything I say and do. And I’m that way towards everyone. And is it right? No. I know that I need to work on it and tone it down in a lot of areas, but I don’t see race or gender or anyone when I’m having a conversation. And if someone upsets me, they upset me the same way that a guy would,” he told Entertainment Weekly at the time. “I know that’s not right, but it has never been anything about demoralizing or being condescending to women.”</p><p>He continued: “It was hard hearing that because I’m an only child and I’m a mama’s boy at heart and I love my mom to death, but I know who I am. And I <a href=#>truly do respect women</a>. I hate that someone may think that out there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For others, although they come off as villains in the house, they still remain fan-favorites. <a href=#>Season 2’s <strong>Dr. Will Kirby</strong></a> came off abrasive during his time on the show, but <a href=#>ultimately took home the win</a> — and was invited back for an all-stars season.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to get an update on the biggest villains from the series and what they’re up to today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXtqh5waumraCVp3q3tculmKKmo2LBqb7Orp6hZaSdsm7FxJqprGWnnbKzsYyaqZ5lpJ2yunnNqK5opZGpwW60zp%2BdppmeZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
