Though it should’ve been one of her happiest moments, <a href=#>Nicole recalls going to bed lonely at the end of the night</a> while speaking to author Dave Karger in his new book 50 Oscar Nights, which hits bookshelves on January 23.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/these-nicole-kidman-movies-have-grossed-over-100-million-at-the-box-office-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="These Nicole Kidman Movies Have Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office">These Nicole Kidman Movies Have Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>While Kidman has been working more with TV series than movies as of late, her most recent film has already brought in over $375 million worldwide.</p><h2 id=nicole-was-lonely-after-winning-an-oscar-and-finalizing-her-divorce>Nicole Was Lonely After Winning An Oscar And Finalizing Her Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nicole-kidman.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was struggling with things in my personal life, yet my professional life was going so well. That’s what happens, right?” Nicole said, mocking the irony of the situation.</p><p>Kidman admitted that she wanted to go straight home after the awards show ended. She had to be convinced to attend the afterparty.</p><p>“I’m not a big party girl, so I was going to skip the Vanity Fair party, and everyone was like, ‘You’ve got to go. You’ve got to walk through the party carrying your Academy Award,’" Kidman continued. "I said, ‘That just feels like gloating, and it doesn’t feel humble.’ Like, what? You can’t walk through carrying the award! That feels really inappropriate. They’re like, ‘That’s what you do.’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nicole went on, “So I literally walked in, carried it around, was completely overwhelmed, emotional, shaking, and I didn’t enjoy it. I was almost apologetic, which is so stupid. I wish I could have enjoyed it more.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the night didn’t get better when she returned to her hotel room. Nicole says eating take-out by herself following the Oscars made her realize she wanted to find love again – Nicole would go on to marry country singer Keith Urban in 2006. They have two teenage daughters.</p><h2 id=nicole-says-the-experience-made-her-want-to-find-love-again>Nicole Says The Experience Made Her Want To Find Love Again</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar53033081.jpg><p>“I went home and ended up ordering takeout and eating it on the floor of the Beverly Hills Hotel," she explained. "I sat on the floor of the hotel eating French fries and a burger with my family and went to bed. That’s when it hit me. I went, I need to find my love; I need a love in my life.
