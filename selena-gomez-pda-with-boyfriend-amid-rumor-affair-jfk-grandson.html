Although fans could not react to the post, there is no doubt the couple appeared happy. <strong>Gomez is also not wasting any time denying the latest claims about her previously being linked to John F. Kennedy's only grandson, Jack Schlossberg.

This power move has proven to be incredibly lucrative for her.</p><p>Schlossberg is a lawyer who graduated from Harvard University. But for those thinking this was a great coupling, Gomez saw the chatter and quickly shut down the idea. In response to a post on Instagram about publications linking her and Schlossberg, Gomez commented, "Never met this human sorry." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She quickly ended any further gossip</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-have-selena-gomez-39-s-fans-said-about-the-dating-rumors>What Have Selena Gomez's Fans Said About The Dating Rumors?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/selena-gomez-boyfriend-1.jpg><p><strong>Fans had previously reacted to the post, though, with some comparing Schlossberg to her current boyfriend, Bennie Blanco</strong>. "This Kennedy guy was a better option than her present!" one comment reads. Another fan wrote, "I love Selena, but I think Selena is a hopeless romantic and falls for any guy that is a little nice to her."</p><p>Other fans showed their support. "@selenagomez, these rumors are CRAZY. Well, either way, Love you, girl," one comment reads. But there was also a lot of confusion. "Wait, what? He cannot promise her the White House it isn't his private property," a comment reads. "Didn't she actually go to the white house?" another comment reads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-in-love>Are Selena Gomez And Benny Blanco In Love?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/selena-gomez-smiling.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez has previously dated</a> Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and Zedd. "I think most of my experiences in relationships have been cursed. I've been way too young to be exposed to certain things when I was in relationships," she told Vogue Australia in an interview in 2021.</p><p>"I guess I needed to find what was that word for me because I felt so less than in past relationships and never really felt equal," Gomez continued about why she named her makeup line Rare Beauty. "And so that word to me – when I first heard it [used in the single Rare] with Nolan [Lambroza], one of the writers, I just said this is what I want to feel about myself. So it wasn't even necessarily like: 'Oh, I feel that way, let me sing it.' It was almost like: 'Actually, I need to feel that way about myself.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>However, she appears to finally have found the man she was meant to be with (although only time will tell if that is true). Gomez and Benny Blanco confirmed their relationship in December 2023</strong>, and they appear to be in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">really good place</a>. "They are so in love," an insider told People in April 2024. "It's a very serious relationship, and they're making long-distance work while she's in New York for work commitments."</p><p>The insider continued, "Benny makes her feel special, and they try to see each other as much as possible. She really does feel like it's the best she's ever been treated by a guy, and she's had a certain glow since they started dating."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-11-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Truth About Selena Gomez's Plastic Surgery Rumors">The Truth About Selena Gomez's Plastic Surgery Rumors</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Whether or not Selena Gomez underwent surgery, the speculation about it has remained strong enough to impact Gomez’s life.</p><p><strong>In March 2024, Gomez put the spotlight on her relationship with Blanco when she celebrated his birthday</strong>. She posted a bunch of sweet photos on Instagram and got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">emotional in the caption</a>. "Happy birthday, baby!
