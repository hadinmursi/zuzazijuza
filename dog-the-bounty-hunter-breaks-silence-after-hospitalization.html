I don’t know. I guess things happen like that. I’ve never … I don’t do drugs.”</p><p>Dog is unsure of what exactly caused the health scare, but he had more tests scheduled for Thursday, September 19, and Friday, September 20.

When <a href=#>Dog was released</a> later that day, his rep told Us, “He is overwhelmed by the support of fans and friends from around the world, and is deeply touched by the outpouring of prayers, love and encouragement.”</p><p>The medical emergency came two months after Beth lost her nearly two-year battle with cancer at the age of 51. She and Dog had been married since May 2006, and they had 13 children between them.</p><p>“I can’t believe she’s gone. She was so gorgeous,” the bounty hunter said at <a href=#>Beth’s public memorial service</a> in Colorado in July. “People would say that and she wouldn’t never believe it, but I told her all the time. She [was] gorgeous, she was so pretty.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadp5diwamxjJumrqakrnqpwc2tnKtlkqeyorfSZqqipJWjsKZ5wJ%2Brnqpdnby0vMitmKWhqpbBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
