Sometimes we have to wonder — have bra designers ever actually tried wearing a bra before? Because so many of them are just horrifically uncomfortable, and we can’t understand the thought and process that went into their design. Bras, especially everyday bras, aren’t just about looks. We’ll take something cute over something plain and boring any day — but we need it to actually feel good!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Because so many of them are just horrifically uncomfortable, and we can’t understand the thought and process that went into their design. Bras, especially everyday bras, aren’t just about looks. We’ll take something cute over something plain and boring any day — but we need it to actually feel good!</p><p>One of the biggest issues we all face with bras is underwire that pokes and prods. That’s why wireless bras are so appealing. But sadly, they often don’t quite get it right either. They have trouble maintaining any sort of shape or structure — yet again not considering the actual shape of a body. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This DEFY bra</a> though? It looks like someone finally got it right!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evelyn & Bobbie DEFY All Day Comfort Wireless Bra</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$68</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>When Evelyn & Bobbie designed this bra, the brand clearly did its research. The reviews don’t lie! They’re all three stars and up, with a vast majority perched high at the full five. Shoppers say it’s the “perfect bra for basically any occasion” and that it’s “the best purchase [they] have made in a long time.” The fabric is so “weightless” and “buttery soft” that they “literally forget” they’re even wearing a bra when they have it on. We can see why they’re calling it a “miracle bra.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This DEFY bra</a> has an expert ergonomic design made to “mimic your anatomy,” therefore reducing shoulder and under-bust pain while smoothing out your upper back. The microfiber fabric feels like a second skin and the bonded seams make everything invisible under even super tight clothing!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evelyn & Bobbie DEFY All Day Comfort Wireless Bra</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$68</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>This bra also features a patented EB Core sling to add significant support, even without any wires. Everything stays in place throughout the day, never riding or rolling up, but still providing a pain-free lift. The thick straps will never loosen either. It’s like sports bra-level support without the flattening effect — just a very flattering one!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This bra</a> is comfy from the start, but you might notice it fits a little snug at first try-on. That’s normal! It’s made to stretch and perfectly mold to your body within two wears max so you’ll have the coziest fit ever. Not sure about your letter size? Scroll down below the photos on Nordstrom to see a very specific and helpful guide. Then you can choose out of three colors — but be quick, because sizes are selling fast. Thankfully there are still plenty left of our fave, the gorgeous blue Lagoon (for now). We might have to pick up a few, because once we put this bra on, we’re not sure we’ll ever be able to switch back to our old ones!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Evelyn & Bobbie DEFY All Day Comfort Wireless Bra</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$68</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
