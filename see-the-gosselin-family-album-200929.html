Amid the hit’s decade-long run, <a href=#>Jon and Kate called it quits after 10 years of marriage</a>.</p><p>“Parents of multiples have triple the divorce rate,” the former labor and delivery nurse said in a 2009 confessional amid Jon’s cheating scandal. “I was thinking we were going to beat that. I don’t know if I can say that anymore.”</p><p>After the title was changed to Kate Plus 8, she went on to participate in more reality shows, competing on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> with pro <a href=#><strong>Tony Dovolani</strong></a> in 2010 and starring in<a href=#> Kate Plus Date</a> nine years later. As for Jon, the Pennsylvania native has worked as a DJ, a waiter and an I.T. support specialist over the years.</p><p>The former couple’s kids no longer all live under one roof. In fact, <a href=#>Jon was awarded sole custody of Collin</a> in December 2018 after the teenager attended a program for children with special needs. <a href=#>Hannah also resides with her dad</a>. The rest of the sextuplets live with Kate. Mady and Cara, for their part, began dorming in <a href=#>their freshman years of college</a> in 2020 at Syracuse University and Fordham University, respectively.</p><p>Jon has spoken candidly about his relationship with Mady, Cara, Leah, Alexia, Aaden and Joel, saying in 2018 that<a href=#> the last time he saw all of his children together</a> was “not [a] good” experience.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was just volatile and a lot going on,” he explained during an event at the time. “It was just not a good time. Like, forced custody and all that kind of stuff. [Leah, Alexis, Joel and Aaden] aren’t talking to me, but they’re talking to Hannah. I don’t get involved now with what the kids … want to do. If they don’t want to talk to me, that’s fine, as long as they keep up with their sibling connections. Eventually, if they come around and they want to talk to me, that’s cool.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how the Gosselin family has changed since they first found fame, from back-to-school photos to vacations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwKaxjK2fnmWXpMC0scuipWaekaK2rcWMmqObrZ1if3F8mGtwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
