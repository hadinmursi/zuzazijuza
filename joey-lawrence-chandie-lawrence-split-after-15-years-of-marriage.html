My greatest blessings,” he wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> alongside a sweet snapshot of his children snuggling up on either side of their puppy. “Being the father of these two amazing, strong, powerful young ladies (and of course my son pictured there in the middle..lol) has brought more joy and happiness into my life then [sic] I ever could have imagined. God bless all the fathers out there who enjoy and share the same blessing of being a Dad. Our job as fathers is unparalleled and literally the most important and meaningful responsibility we ever could have.”</p><p>In March 2018, Us confirmed that the formerly married couple went through a rocky financial period, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after large amounts in credit card debt, back taxes and unpaid loans began to pile up. In order to keep their family afloat, court documents claimed that the duo <a href=#>sold their clothes, furniture and other accessories</a> before initially filing for bankruptcy nearly one year earlier. At the time, the <a href=#>Brotherly Love</a> star’s three cars, a Ford Flex, a Bentley and a BMW, were repossessed.</p><p>A month after the <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a> alum’s financial troubles made headlines, <a href=#>his case was settled</a> and the pair was left to repay a significant sum to various creditors, including the IRS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5Wueq2t1qucp5uVYrCprc2doJ5lnJbEs7HNnJxmq6ChtrV5wJ%2BrnqpdZoJuxcSaqaxln5t6rq3Rq6Can5Vk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
