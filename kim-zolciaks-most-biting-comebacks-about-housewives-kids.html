Whether she’s lashing out at her <a href=#>Real Housewives of Atlanta</a>&nbsp;costars or internet trolls who dared to comment on her children, the reality star knows how to put haters in their place.</p><p>The Bravo personality made her debut on&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Atlanta&nbsp;in 2008. The original cast member starred alongside <a href=#><strong>NeNe Leakes</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Shereé Whitfield</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kandi Burruss</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Phaedra Parks</strong></a>, <strong>Lisa Wu</strong> and <strong>DeShawn Snow</strong> during her first stint on the reality series. The “Don’t Be Tardy” singer left the show after season 4.</p><p>Zolciak-Biermann later returned during seasons 9 and 10. Her onscreen and offscreen feud with Leakes in 2017 forced the songstress to declare she would <a href=#>“never, never” appear on the show again</a>, noting that it is “too much stress, unneeded stress.”</p><p>The following year, a source confirmed as much to Us Weekly.&nbsp;“Kim and Bravo agreed she <a href=#>wouldn’t come back</a>,” the insider said at the time. “None of the girls will film with her. They refuse.”</p><p>In between appearing on&nbsp;Real Housewives, Zolciak-Biermann landed her own spinoff titled&nbsp;<a href=#>Don’t Be Tardy</a>, which premiered on Bravo in April 2012. The show ran for eight seasons until December 2020, but Zolciak-Biermann wasn’t shedding tears over the cancellation.</p><p>“Kim’s not sad about Don’t Be Tardy ending. Yes, it’s emotional because of how long her family filmed the show and all the memories they created, but she sees this as a positive change,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time. “She feels like she’s finally free after a 13-year-long relationship to get to do other projects she’s wanted to do.”</p><p>Throughout her run on Bravo, the podcast host expanded her family. She married former NFL player <a href=#><strong>Kroy Biermann</strong></a> in November 2011 and they later welcomed sons Kroy Jr. (born in 2011) and Kash (born in 2012) as well as twins Kane and Kaia (born in 2013). The athlete also <a href=#>adopted Zolciak-Biermann’s eldest daughters</a> <a href=#><strong>Brielle</strong></a> and Ariana from her previous relationships in July 2013.</p><p>Brielle opened up to&nbsp;Us&nbsp;about <a href=#>expanding the family further</a> in February 2019. “I think if she got pregnant again, I’d be like, ‘Are you OK? Are you insane?’” she admitted, adding: “Don’t have any more kids. We’re jam-packed as it is!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The family did not expand before Zolciak-Biermann and her husband split.
