In a new interview with Power 105.1's The Breakfast Club, Rose got candid about her ex and their marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, he's young, he has a lot of life to live," Rose said of 27-year-old Khalifa. "Now that I'm done crying, it doesn't bother me anymore. Now's my time to live. I'll never say never because he's the father of the my child. He's still technically my husband. But right now, with all he's doing, I'm not with it."</p><p>When the radio show's hosts brought up several allegations of cheating, Rose remained vague, saying, "It's like 'Dude that's not you.' That's not my husband. That's not the man that I know. Wiz isn't a bad guy. He has great spirit, that's why I married him. People make mistakes."</p><p>One co-host claimed the young rapper was "allowed three hall passes," to which Rose replied, " What if he…," "Used them up?" another co-host asked, and she nodded her head.&nbsp;</p><p>The former model and actress claimed she never cheated on Khalifa, but now that things are over between them, she's happy to meet new people. She did, however, shoot down the rumors about a romance with her manager <strong><a href=#>Nick Cannon</a></strong>, saying, "He's like family."&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>When asked if she too changed in their marriage, the mom of son <strong>Sebastian</strong>, almost 2, replied, "I became a mother. I'm not at the club every night, downing shots. My priorities changed for sure."</p><p><strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>'s ex, who is now good friends with <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>'s former pal <strong>Blac Chyna</strong>, also gave her candid thoughts on <strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a></strong>'s rumored relationship with rapper <strong>Tyga</strong> — the father of Blac Chyna's son.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"She's a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o'clock and relax," Rose said of Jenner. "That's ridiculous. [Tyga] should be ashamed of himself. For sure. He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17."</p><p>The outspoken Philly native is working on a book called How to Be a Bad Bitch. In it, she chronicles her life and choices.&nbsp;</p><p>"Every mistake that I've made so far, I'm showing these girls how to not do that," Rose said. "It's like I'm Jesus. I made the mistake for them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav26%2BzqycZq%2BZr3qstMCloJ%2BZXZi1pq3Tnptmp55itaa%2BjKaspayZpbmmedOipJ6rXWd9coGQbmlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
