We have acted swiftly and decisively to demonstrate our commitment to a culture of decency, civility and tolerance.”</p><p>The company, which was featured on <i>Shark Tank</i> in 2014, previously announced its partnership with Griffin on May 10, and released a commercial of the actress promoting the brand’s line of toilet footstools.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/8405e5c3c24_donald-trump-zoom-1a5f8dea-6a87-454d-b6b5-101e3179e985.jpg><p>Hours after the gory photo was posted on Tuesday, May 30, Griffin released a video apology on her Twitter account. “I sincerely apologize. I’m just now seeing the reaction to these images. I’m a comic. I cross the line. I move the line then I cross it. I went way too far,” she said. “The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn’t funny. I get it. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career, I will continue. I ask your forgiveness.”</p><p>https://twitter.com/kathygriffin/status/869703678550171648</p><p>Despite the mea culpa, Griffin has faced major backlash. Trump, 70, lambasted the <i>Suddenly Susan</i> actress on Wednesday, May 31, tweeting, “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself.
