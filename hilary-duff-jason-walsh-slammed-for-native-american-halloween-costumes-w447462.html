Another added, “No @HilaryDuff Traditional dress is not a costume and you being dressed as a pilgrim proves to me how insensitive and ignorant you are.”</p><p>“Look at how much work dude put into being racist,” one fan wrote in reference to Walsh’s elaborate costume, feathered headdress and red face paint.</p><p>Some social media users also pointed out that the new couple’s costume choices were particularly insensitive in the wake of the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy in North Dakota, where thousands of Native Americans and supporters are protesting the construction of a 1,134-mile-long pipeline that would destroy sacred grounds.</p><p>“So is @HilaryDuff and her bf gonna protest that pipeline [affecting] native Americans or ?” one fan tweeted.

I sincerely and unreservedly apologize to all First Nations people for this thoughtless action. I now appreciate that there is a great need for a deeper understanding of the complex and extensive issues facing indigenous communities. I hope that in highlighting my own ignorance I can help in some small way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahoZyWv7p5w66dn2WalsCwuoywmKWrmGLAra3MppydZZakv266wK2gr51dlrqmvsicmKdlmJa5rbvWnpynZZOkwLXBzJ6qZq9kaYR1gpFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
