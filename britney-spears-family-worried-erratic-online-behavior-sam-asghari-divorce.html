However, the singer’s recent behavior is starting to worry her family.</p><p>Britney was released from her 13-year conservatorship in November 2001. Since 2008, most of her professional and personal life has been under the control of her team, especially her father, Jamie Spears.</p><p>She was quick to marry her long-time boyfriend the year after, amid reports she’d been prevented from doing so. However, Sam and Britney’s marriage lasted a little more than a year, before he filed for divorce on August 16 citing “irreconcilable differences.” Numerous reports suggest Sam believes Britney was cheating on him. It’s also <a href=#>been alleged the singer physically attacked him</a>, prompting the split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-rsquo-s-online-behavior-has-been-more-provocative>`Britney’s Online Behavior Has Been More Provocative</h2><p>Despite the divorce, Britney has remained active on social media with a variety of provocative content. Last week, she threw a “divorce party” where she lived it up with a variety of shirtless men. One video even showed a mystery gentleman licking her thigh and calf.</p><p>Another report claims she’s getting close to a former employee with a criminal history. He was previously <a href=#>hired as a housekeeper without a proper background check.</a> Though he’s since been let go, Britney and him reportedly remain in contact.</p><p>The singer has also been seen out and about with a mystery man on several occasions, prompting speculation about whether she’s moving on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=concern-for-britney-rsquo-s-welfare-is-ldquo-off-the-charts-rdquo>Concern For Britney’s Welfare Is “Off The Charts”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/untitled-design-48.jpg><p>Just as Britney’s behavior is causing concern amongst fans, it’s also making people around her raise their eyebrows, a new report suggests.</p><p>“Some people are of the opinion that Britney’s on a dangerous downward spiral,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Us Weekly</a>. “And the stuff she’s been [doing] hasn’t done much to dampen that worry. The concern for Britney’s welfare right now is off the charts.”</p><p>“She was finally getting to a positive place, and then Sam filed for divorce. People are worried how all of this will affect her,” another source added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Britney Spears Forms Unlikely Bond With Her Ex-Housekeeper During Divorce, But He Has A Dangerous Past</a></span></p><p>The insider also said that Britney is more open than ever to repairing her relationship with her family, since she feels isolated without Sam. “Now that she no longer has Sam to rely on, Britney’s more open to possibly repairing things with her mom,” they went on. “She’s not sure they can ever fully recover, but she’s open to it.”</p><p>As for Sam, reports say that his estranged wife’s recent antics have only <a href=#>made him confident in his decision to walk away</a> from the marriage.</p><p>“Sam isn’t sure if Britney was trying to get his attention on social media by throwing a divorce party and partying with other men, but it’s none of his business,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Us Weekly</a>. “It only reinforces his feelings on the split and knowing he did the right thing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been allegations that Sam plans to challenge his prenup with Britney, as he may get nothing, given that it only entitled him to $1 million after every 2 years of marriage (to be capped after a decade together). The couple were only married for 14 months. However, he’s denied the rumors and their divorce proceedings remain ongoing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2KzornIpbBmr5%2Bnv6qxw2acq6qRqbakec6no6KmlWKvprTAr6Coql2orq55wKyeoZminnqltdWoqZydXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
