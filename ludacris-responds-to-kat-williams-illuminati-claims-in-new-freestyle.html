Ludacris, 46, dropped new bars in a social media video on Thursday, January 4, responding to claims Williams, 52, made on Shannon Sharpe’s “Club Shay Shay” podcast one day prior.
“Whatever’s heavy on my heart is always on my mind / Like Snoop [Dogg]’s cannabis shredder, I’m always on my grind,” began Ludacris, rapping over an instrumental version of Kanye West’s “Devil in a New Dress” from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Williams went on to claim that both he and Ludacris were once “invited to an Illuminati thing, and it had to be one or the other of us and decisions had to be made.”</p><p>“So it was both of us. We were equal. One of us had to cut off all their hair and couldn’t do the sideburn thing no more, with the points,” said Williams. “And the next person they said was going to get $200 million because they were going to pay him <a href=#>$10 million a movie</a> to do 20 movies. And that’s how the conversation happened. One of those persons turned out to be Ludacris, and the other person turned out to be Katt Williams.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ludacris-Drops-Freestyle-Responding-to-Katt-Williams-Accusing-Him-of-Being-Part-of-the-Illuminati-Inline.jpg><p>Williams took aim at a handful of big stars in his interview. He said<strong> Steve Harvey</strong> “look(s) like Mr. Potato Head,” accusing him of stealing the premise for The Steve Harvey Show from <strong>Mark Cooper</strong>’s Hangin’ with Mr. Cooper. Williams further alleged that <strong>Cedric the Entertainer</strong> has stolen jokes from him, that<strong> Kevin Hart i</strong>s an “industry plant” and that <strong>Rickey Smiley</strong> and<strong> Tyler Perry</strong> “can’t play a man to save their life.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Williams added, “They play good women, and I believe that the best actor should be in the best role.”</p><p>Hart, 44, <a href=# rel=noopener>responded </a>to Williams’ allegations via social media on Thursday. “Gotta get that anger up outcha champ….It’s honestly sad,” Hart wrote, sharing a teaser of his latest project. “In the meantime…. Please enjoy MY MOVIE TRAILER to my next film ‘LIFT’ which will be dropping on @netflixin 8 days!!!! There is a moment in the trailer where @gugumbatharaw says, ‘They Really Love You’ ….I now know she’s talking about ‘Katt.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOunJGYv6q%2FjKucrKifo7G0edOoZKSZpGLEqrjLopimq12eua3BzKKlmqyZYrCtrcimqmahnmK7psOMn6menaOpxq2xjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
