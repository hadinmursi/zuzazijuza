It has frightened me and my family, as we didn't know what was happening," the radio and TV personality explained. "We didn't know at the time what was causing me to feel as though, out of nowhere, my hands and feet, or arms and legs would feel like someone had just crushed them, set them on fire or pushed broken glass into them."</p><p>Things got so bad that while he was at Fox, Beck had worked out a signal with his producers to take the camera off of him when the pain became too extreme. Despite rarely sleeping, the host was never tired. He tried switching up his diet and medications but nothing seemed to work. At one point he was told he would no longer be able to function in five to 10 years and began looking for his replacement.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, Beck and his wife, <strong>Tania Colonna</strong>, found a solution at the Carrick Brain Centers in Texas.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"We went and after a few short visits they found that I had several things going on —&nbsp;from an autoimmune disorder to adrenal fatigue, and they found the connection on everything that was going on," he said. "Me never having to sleep was finally understandable. The last sign of adrenal failure is a hyperextension of your adrenal glands. In other words, I didn't need sleep. I could have been lifting cars during my time at Fox!"</p><p>Now Beck has spent months getting back on track and is happy to report that he’s going to be just fine.</p><p>"My brain is back online in a big way," he said. "I have received a clean bill of health."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagpJWju26uxJyiZqqVq7KiuNJmqq6elpq%2FqrrGZqmaqpViu6bB0aijqJ%2BZmK6tecilo6edo6h6c3yQbWhqaWFk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
