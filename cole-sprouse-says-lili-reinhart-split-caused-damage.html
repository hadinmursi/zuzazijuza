Cole Sprouse offered a rare glimpse into his personal life while discussing his past relationships — including his high-profile romance with Riverdale costar Lili Reinhart.
Sprouse, 30, opened up about the ups and downs of his dating history in a sneak peek of the Wednesday, March 9, episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, claiming he’s been cheated on “by almost every single one” of his ex-girlfriends.
When asked about the aftermath of his split from Reinhart, 26, Sprouse noted that the former couple — who continued to work with each other post-breakup — didn’t handle it well at first."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
