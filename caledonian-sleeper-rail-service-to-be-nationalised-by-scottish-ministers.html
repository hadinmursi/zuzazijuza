The Caledonian Sleeper rail service will be nationalised after Scottish ministers moved to terminate the operating company’s franchise agreement seven years early.
It will be operated by an arm’s length company owned by the Scottish government from 25 June, transport minister Jenny Gilruth told MSPs in Holyrood on Thursday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

added that the decision to bring the service into public hands would not be a permanent one, saying she and officials would continue to monitor “market conditions”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>John Whitehurst, managing director of Serco’s transport business, told <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">BBC News</a> that the company was disappointed that the Scottish government “did not ensure value for money by examining the possibility of a direct contract award to Serco”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He said that the award would have “allowed <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Scotland</a> to benefit from the expertise of our Serco transport senior management team who understand this complex and unique hospitality-focused train operation like no one else, while also enabling Scottish ministers to be in complete control of the contract”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He added: “Most importantly, this would have allowed the Scottish government to compare the price of such an award with that of their arm’s length operator of last resort company.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>RMT’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said the Scottish government had “done the right thing”, while Aslef’s Scottish organiser, Kevin Lindsay, said Serco’s control of the service had been “an abject failure”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>However, Lindsay said he was disappointed that the Caledonian Sleeper and ScotRail franchises are not being combined, something Gilruth told MSPs she is in favour of.</p><figure id=6cb34f50-d314-4edd-8045-dc04fda0e741
