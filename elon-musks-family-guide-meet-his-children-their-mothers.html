Plus being knocked up is a very feral and war-like state of being,” the England native, whose real name is Claire Boucher, captioned a nude bump photo in January 2020. “Might as well be what it is. Plus most of my friends told me not to post them so then I was afflicted with reverse psychology. Interrogated my shame on it and decided it was sum [sic] weird internalized self-hatred to feel uncomfortable about my body. Hope you’re having a nice day!”</p><p>The visual artist <a href=#>gave birth</a> to son<a href=#> X AE A X-II</a> in May 2020.
