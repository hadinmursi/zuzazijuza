I believe them, even if I don’t,” Tucci wrote.</p><p>The Emmy winner went on to hilariously detail Isabel, Nicolo, Camilla and their friend’s epic food consumption, writing, “The older generation … enter the kitchen and make quick work of an entire loaf of bread, two pints of cherry tomatoes, four avocados, six eggs, two pints of blueberries, four bananas, 20 rashers of bacon, one liter of almond milk, six Nespresso pods and a liter of orange juice. … [Five hours later], the older children have now come downstairs to eat an entire f–king meal before dinner.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tucci knows he is “lucky” to be in this situation with his family, no matter how “frustrated” he can get at times, the Devil Wears Prada star went on to write. “[We] have one another, a roof over our heads, food in our bellies and no symptoms of illness.”</p><p>For now, the Grammy nominee is enjoying cooking meals — lamb chops, chicken stock and pasta all norma — and entertaining Matteo and Emilia. He and the little ones play a made-up game “Mean King,” have wrestling matches that end in “nappy-changing duties” and jump on their backyard trampoline while being sprayed with a hose.</p><i>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19,</i><i>&nbsp;</i><i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i><i>wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
