The <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star and the <a href=#>Flip It Like Disick</a> personality each moved on since calling it quits with each other — but their connection has never fully fizzled out. During an August 2019 episode of his reality show, however, Disick <a href=#>admitted that he felt “insecure”</a> while he was dating Kardashian.</p><p>“I feel like years ago, when I was, like, younger and stuff, I don’t know that I’ve been, like, motivated to, like, do all these things for the kids and, like, build houses for them,” he told his ex, referring to their <a href=#>sons Mason and Reign</a>, and daughter <a href=#>Penelope</a>. “I was just so insecure that, like, everybody would look at me like I’m not cool or young anymore.
