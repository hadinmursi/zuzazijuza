Muslim Religion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Faryal Makhdoom is claimed to belong to the Shia community by&nbsp;The Online Muslim Community&nbsp;Her husband, Amir, however, is a Sunni. The divide between these two groups within the Muslim community is the largest and oldest in history.</p><p>Although both of them follow the same Religion-Islam, their beliefs are different which has divided them for centuries now. Shia believes that just as God alone appoints prophets, God alone has the authority to appoint a prophet’s successor.</p><p>They believe that God chose Ali to be Muhammad’s infallible successor, the first caliph (Khalifah, or head of state) of Islam. Thus, they believed in the lineage of Muhammad’s family through a series of Imams.</p><p>In contrast, Sunni focus on following Prophet’s examples. They believe that human redemption is contingent on faith in Allah and his prophets, acceptance of Muhammad as the final prophet, and belief in righteous deeds as explained in the Koran.</p><p>They believe that Allah’s mercy will determine the redemption of all human beings.</p><p>It is surprising how two people from contradicting beliefs have got married and set up a family. However, it is exemplary that the couple is happily married and have not let their religious belief affect their relationship.</p><p>She was once asked by a Twitter user if she is a Shia or not to which she replied- “She is a Muslim”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=take-a-look-at-faryal-makhdoom-without-makeup></span>Take A Look At Faryal Makhdoom Without Makeup<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Faryal Makhdoom once shared a video of her without makeup.

The video has been taken down and is not available on her Instagram profile.</p><p>Before that video, she was rarely seen without makeup. On the contrary, she is known for doing heavy makeup.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faryal-makhdoom-wikipedia-and-net-worth></span>Faryal Makhdoom Wikipedia and Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Faryal Makhdoom is not available on Wikipedia as of 2021.
