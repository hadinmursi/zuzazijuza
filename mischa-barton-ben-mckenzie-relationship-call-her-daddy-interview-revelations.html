If there's one thing that fans know about the sometimes <a href=#>controversial Call Her Daddy podcast</a>, it's that stars are going to talk about topics that they might not elsewhere.</p><p>When <strong>Mischa Barton was interviewed </strong>on Call Her Daddy in February 2024, she shared stories about The O.C. and also got super personal. While fans have heard about <a href=#>Mischa Barton's behavior on set</a> and they know that her character <strong>Marissa Cooper was killed off in the season 3 finale</strong>, the actress hasn't opened up that much in interviews. In this article, we'll take a look at what Mischa Barton told Alex Cooper about her love life, along with some other fascinating reveals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mischa-barton-talked-about-ben-mckenzie-and-her-dating-life-in-her-call-her-daddy-interview>Mischa Barton Talked About Ben McKenzie And Her Dating Life In Her Call Her Daddy Interview</h2><p>When Mischa Barton was interviewed by Alex Cooper for the Call Her Daddy episode that was released on, she shared a few details about dating Ben McKenzie. She said, "That was my first" relationship and added, "I had no idea what I was doing." She explained that there was an age difference as <strong>she was 17 years old when dating the 25-year-old </strong>actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mischa-barton-ben-mckenzie-graduation-the-o-c.jpg><p>However, <strong>Mischa Barton spilled about her love life </strong>and was more vulnerable than she has been in other interviews. When Alex Cooper asked what Barton is looking for in her next relationship, Barton said that she <strong>changed her perspective on dating</strong>. She said that she used to be interested in only going out with musicians, but said, "Those days are over. That's not attractive to me anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She shared that when she was a twentysomething, she found it "cool" to date someone who was on tour. But now that she's older, she doesn't want that anymore.</p><p>Chances are that many people can relate to her. Even if someone didn't date famous singers or band members, they can understand wanting to be in a relationship with someone mature. While of course many musicians live stable lives, it sounds like Barton prioritized having a good time when she was younger. She didn't share the names of any musicians she dated, however.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-call-her-daddy-s-most-shocking-moments-reveal-the-point-of-alex-cooper-s-podcast-2.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Has Mischa Barton Dated?</a> (According to Hollywood Life)</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Brandon Davis (2004-2005)</strong></li><li><strong>Cisco Adler (August 2005-February 2007)</strong></li><li><strong>James Abercrombie (2017-2019)</strong></li><li><strong>Gian Marco Flamini (2021-unknown)</strong></li></ul><p>Barton talked about the kind of person she wants to date now and said:</p><p>"I like people who are driven and have their own stuff going on.

She talked about the partying that she did and explained:</p><p>"I thought I was going to be dead by 27. I was going to be part of that 27 club. It was like, live young and fast... I was reckless. I was over it.

According to Entertainment Weekly, she was in West Hollywood, California just before 3 a.m. when she was arrested. She also mentioned being given a roofie, which is terrifying to hear about.
