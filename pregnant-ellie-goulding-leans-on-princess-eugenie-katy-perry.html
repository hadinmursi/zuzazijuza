The team around me is all female which massively helps.”</p><p>Goulding also explained her reasoning behind announcing her pregnancy last month, at the 30-week mark, saying, “I needed time to get my head around it. I needed that space to process what was happening.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Close to Me” singer, who learned she is expecting baby No. 1 with Jopling, 29, in August 2020, admitted she was able to keep the news under wraps amid the coronavirus pandemic lockdown by <a href=#>wearing her husband’s big coats</a>.</p><p>Once the couple moved into a new house, she said, “It felt like we had these proper roots, and it was the right moment to say something.”</p><p>Goulding <a href=#>announced that she was having her first child</a> on February 23, telling Vogue, “The thought of getting pregnant didn’t seem like it could be a reality. Becoming pregnant kind of made me feel human. I want a better word than womanly, [but] I have curves I’ve never had before. I’m enjoying it. My husband’s enjoying it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602acpaSZmnqou9Slm6Kml2K5pq3NrGSopl2lv6q6wp6qrGWVqrSmusieZKSZpK56sbHRq7Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
