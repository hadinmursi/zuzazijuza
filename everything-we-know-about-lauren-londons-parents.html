Lauren’s parents divorced when she three years old, signaling the start of Lauren’s identity crisis. London’s maternal cousins taunted her for ‘not being black enough’ while, during visits to her dad, her white friends teased her being black. However, as time went by, Lauren learned to be comfortable in her own skin. She told Kathleen Cross:</p><p>“If someone thinks I’m not black enough that’s their issue. I’m okay with who I am and it is what it is. I am a Black woman like my mother, and I love who my father is, and I love both sides of me. Nobody makes a big deal about it anymore because I won’t take that anymore.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=lauren-believes-that-raising-her-two-sons-%e2%80%98saved-her></span>Lauren believes that raising her two sons ‘saved her’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lauren is quite secretive about her parents, but she has opened up about how being a parent has impacted her life. London has two sons: Kameron Carter from her relationship with Lil Wayne and Ermias Asghedom from her relationship with Nipsey Hussle. On 10th May 2020, Lauren posted a photo of her son’s embracing, and revealed on the caption that being a mother has ‘saved her.’ She wrote: “The absolute Honor of being their mother. This love have saved me. Peace to all the mommas. Happy Mother’s Day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2mmr%2B6wMeipaBlp5p6rLrOsGSamp%2BqwW64wK6pnqZdobyvsM6nqmaokaeyr8DSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
