And if I do get a formal offer, I’m not telling anybody. … I’m just gonna walk on,” she quipped via Instagram Live, <a href=#>noting that former bestie Shannon “better hope I don’t come back.”</a></p><p>The CUT Fitness owner added that she’s still in contact with Gina and Braunwyn.</p><p>“Dream cast [would be] <a href=#><strong>Heather [DuBrow],</strong></a> <a href=#><strong>Vicki [Gunvalson],</strong></a> Shannon — just because I want to give her a piece of my mind — Braunwyn and Gina,” she said. “I think that would be a really good cast. And<strong> Meghan [King]</strong> too. I really like Meghan, but Meghan doesn’t live in Orange County anymore.”</p><p>While Tamra hasn’t been watching the season, she believes change is coming to the OG franchise. “I do think there’s going to be a shakeup. A big shakeup. … I only see clips on Instagram, the highlights and I see the comments,” she noted. “There’s no shortage of story line on [Braunwyn]. She’s not going anywhere. I don’t [think Emily or Elizabeth will return].”</p><p>Tamra added that she’ll “be curious to see what happens” with Kelly after she made headlines for her <a href=#>controversial coronavirus comments.</a></p><p>“The viewers and the public have been very vocal. It’s one of those things — sometimes she is good TV and then there’s that other part,” she said, before referring to Kelly as “evil.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When asked who she thinks is the most “real,” Tamra added, “I think that Gina is extremely real. I feel like Gina is who she is. I don’t feel like she’s calculated. … I feel like Shannon is very self-produced. Kelly is real, what you see is what you get. … I think Braunwyn is real. I think that she exposes a lot, I think that she has a lot going on in her life.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Orange County airs Wednesday nights at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p><p>Scroll through for pics from the reunion:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bprq6%2BwGahrpyXmnq1scCsnKxlop28pHnSnpisp55ifnZ50Z6sp6Gfo3qkrcyepmavmJbBbsPEZqKnp6dk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
