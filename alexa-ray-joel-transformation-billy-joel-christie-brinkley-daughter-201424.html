Many remember Alexa Ray Joel as Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley's adorable, grinning little girl, but the now-28-year-old singer looked surprisingly transformed on Tuesday, April 1.  
Performing at Cafe Carlyle in New York City, Joel posed in a cleavage-baring, lace-covered corset and long, printed skirt. 
Her angular jawline, flawless skin, and sultry pout were a far cry from the beaming preteen many remember. But that doesn't mean she's had work done to look this glamorous."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But that doesn't mean she's had work done to look this glamorous. According to her rep, the musician's new look is simply, well, maturity.</p><p>"Alexa has never had any plastic surgery other than a rhinoplasty, which she has admitted to," the rep tells Us. "She's simply matured into a beautiful young woman."</p><p>The singer mirrored the sentiment on her Facebook page, writing, "The continuously-circulating rumors that I have had extensive 'face-work' and undergone breast-augmentation surgery is simply and entirely 100% false. The only thing I have ever had done is my nose, which I have always been completely candid, honest, and open about."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Alexa is the daughter of Joel, 64, and model Brinkley, 60. She has been performing since age 19 when she first put together a band and played local shows in New Jersey. Her performance in New York last night was sold out. &nbsp;</p><p>"It was a pristine honor to grace a stage that has seen such legendary-greats as Bobby Short, Woody Allen, and– my personal fave– Eartha Kitt," she wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. "This 2-week long showcase (from April 1st-12th) is my very own handmade love-letter to New York, from start to finish; every minute-element of the performance, from my reinterpreted covers, to my original-material, to every note on the cello- was arranged wholly by me- And I can truly say that this is the first performance-run I've ever done where every beat of the show is coming entirely from the deepest dwellings of my heart and mind."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaapJWtrm6%2BwLJko6eVoXq1vsCnqp%2BnoqKutbXOp2SboZyhxm62zp6jZpuYp7a0wMieZJuqmaO4rbHYZpuarZedwaa%2BjGtnamxiaXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
