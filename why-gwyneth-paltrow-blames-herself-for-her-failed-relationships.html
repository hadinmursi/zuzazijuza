After all, the vast majority of them are quite wealthy and that is to say nothing about the fact that when stars go out, most people they interact with are willing to bend over backward for them. That said, there certainly are some aspects of being a celebrity that sucks.

In fact, even when it comes to some celebrities that people really like, if they remain single for a very long time, people begin to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talk about that</a>.</p><p>During Gwyneth Paltrow’s time in the public eye, she has been romantically linked to several men. Of course, given how successful and gorgeous Paltrow is, it can be easy at times to forget that just like the rest of us, she has setbacks. As it turns out, when it comes to the setbacks Paltrow has had in her love life, she seemingly blames herself for a lot of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Abigail Breslin's Love Life</a></span></p><h2 id=an-enviable-career>An Enviable Career</h2><p>Seemingly born to be a star, Gwyneth Paltrow is the daughter of famed actor Blythe Danner and the producer-director, Bruce Paltrow. Made famous when she landed a supporting role in 1995’s Seven, from there Paltrow’s career quickly climbed due to her work in films like Shakespeare in Love and The Talented Mr. Ripley.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After proving how great she was as an actor during the late-90s, Paltrow became one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood. For example, Paltrow is a huge part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since she played a significant role in the success of Iron Man, the movie that got the whole franchise rolling. In fact, Paltrow has become so famous that many of her fans line up to see her films and want to know everything they can about what went on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">behind the scenes</a> of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look At Gwyneth Paltrow's Forgotten Number One Hit</a></span></p><h2 id=gwyneth-s-love-life>Gwyneth’s Love Life</h2><p>Ever since Gwyneth Paltrow first rose to prominence, a lot has been made of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her love life</a>. As for why that is the case, there are good reasons as Paltrow tends to speak about most aspects of her life very candidly and she has been involved with several heartthrobs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most notably, Gwyneth Paltrow was married to Coldplay singer Chris Martin from 2003 until 2016. While the couple ultimately couldn’t make things work, they had two children together and remain close according to both of them. After Paltrow’s first marriage ended, she began dating producer Brad Falchuk and the couple walked down the aisle in 2018.</p><p>Long before Gwyneth Paltrow was wed for the first time, she nearly tied the knot with Brad Pitt who she was engaged to and dated from 1994 until 1997. From there, Paltrow’s next high-profile romance was with Ben Affleck, a man she was involved with off and on from 1997 until 2000. After that split, Paltrow briefly was linked to Luke Wilson before she married Chris Martin. On top of all those relationships, Paltrow briefly dated Robert Sean Leonard and there are rumors she had flings with Viggo Mortensen, Scott Speedman, and Bryan Adams.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened Between Chris Martin And Gwyneth Paltrow?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-personal-perspective>A Personal Perspective</h2><p>Ever since Gwyneth Paltrow became famous for more than just being an actor, she has been very open about her personal life and feelings. While Paltrow and her brand GOOP have been the subject of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">great scorn on social media</a>, many people appreciate her willingness to put herself out there. For example, in 2017 Paltrow made an appearance on Girlboss Radio with Sophia Amoruso and was very frank about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">failings in the romance department</a>.</p><p>“I’ve f----- up so many relationships, so many,”</p><p>“I’m actually a pretty good friend and a good sister and a daughter and a mother, but I am at my potentially most vulnerable and f----- up in the romantic slice of the pie. So it’s taken me a lot of work to get to the place where I have a good romantic relationship.”</p><p>In response to Gwyneth Paltrow taking on a lot of blame for her romances ending, Girlboss Radio host Sophia Amoruso jokingly said; “So, Brad Pitt, if you’re listening—”. Quick to respond, Paltrow addressed the end of her relationship with Pitt in no uncertain terms; “I f----- that up, Brad”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gwyneth Paltrow went on to address prioritizing her current marriage and why she feels that is important. “So if you don’t have a good relationship with your partner, your children, your best friends, then I think it’s very hard to claim success,” she said. “It makes life feel full and rich and happy. Like, the quality of your relationships dictate so much how your life feels, so for me that’s the number one.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dream Come True: 15 Celebs Who Are Open To Dating Their Fans</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnMS6usStn2aokaHBs7vWZpmlmZ2awG60xKuqnqSWYrOwvoyhnKtllpa2rbHDZqmepJGptrC60qGgqatf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
