The German supermodel explained why she’s so comfortable baring her body in an interview for the December issue of <a href=#><i>Ocean Drive</i></a> magazine.</p><p>The <i>Project Runway</i> host, 43, is frequently photographed <a href=#>ditching her bikini top </a>on tropical vacations with her boyfriend, <b>Vito Schnabel</b>. “I grew up going to nude beaches with my parents, so I’m a nudist,” she told the magazine. “I have no problems with nudity at all. I’m very free. When I go to the beach, it’s in a very remote place where there are not a lot of people, and I like to go topless.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, the lingerie designer lamented that paparazzi follow the couple and capture their intimate moments. “I’m not doing PDA on the beach with tons of people. I go on a boat or I take a hike somewhere. If you would zoom out in the places where I’m with my boyfriend, there’s nobody there,” she said. “But to the outside word, it looks like we’re frolicking on the beach having a show in front of everyone.”</p><p>Klum also defended her relationship with <a href=#>her art curator beau</a>, who is 13 younger than the <i>America’s Got Talent</i> judge. “It’s not about age,” Klum said. “We have an amazing connection, we have fun together and we love each other. It doesn’t matter what people say. As long as you know when you close your door in your own home, you have an amazing time together. That’s really all that matters."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>The former <a href=#>Victoria's Secret Angel</a> has learned to stay confident and handle criticism throughout her lengthy career. “When you’re a normal girl from a small town and no one really takes note of you, and then all of a sudden you’re walking down a catwalk in your lingerie and on the cover of <i>Sports Illustrated,</i> and all these people are turning their heads when you go into a restaurant and pointing their finger at you saying, ‘She’s not as pretty in person as she is in photos,’ you get a little insecure. You always get judged, so you have to learn how to handle it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahnZmZtm63y66kZquRrsBuv8eeZKCqlax6tryMmqpmmV2jwqW10q1ksGxlZ4N1gI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
