Though Jed told Hannah he loved her, she left his hometown worried that their relationship or his music would suffer if they stayed together.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Luke Parker</strong>’s family and friends defended him fiercely when Hannah questioned his character and mentioned the repeated issues he had with the other men in the house. His father and brother insisted that the behavior she described was not representative of who he truly is, while fellow church members called him the “real deal” and the “nicest” guy.</p><p>Luke told Hannah he was in love with her at the end of his hometown date. To the cameras, Hannah started to confess that she was in love with him too … before she stopped short, amending her statement to “falling in love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Elsewhere in the episode, <strong>Peter Weber</strong> hesitated to say “I love you” to Hannah, and the Bachelorette’s fears about <strong>Tyler Cameron</strong> being unprepared for an engagement were put to rest by his family’s assurance of his intentions.</p><p>Hannah made an unprecedented move when it came time for the rose ceremony. With her decision down to eliminating either Jed or Luke, she opted to <a href=#>take all four men to fantasy suites</a>.</p><p>The Bachelorette&nbsp;airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XrqS0xKWmq52kqbJutsSdqmaln6J6tK3YrGShnaNiu7DAjKucmpypYsGwecaeq2adnpyuqLHDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
