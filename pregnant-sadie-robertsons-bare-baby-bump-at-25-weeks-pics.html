I threw up every day until week 22. At times it felt exhausting.”</p><p>Last month, the “WHOA That’s Good” podcast host exclusively told Us Weekly that <a href=#>her symptoms were “gnarly”</a> from weeks seven to 17.</p><p>“That was about 10 weeks of throwing up every day,” Robertson explained in December 2020. “Definitely humbled me, kept me on my toes, but now I love being pregnant. It is truly amazing.”</p><p>The Louisana native’s husband, <a href=#><strong>Christian Huff</strong></a>, pampered the pregnant star during her bouts of morning sickness, which “shocked” her. The mom-to-be told Us, “You never know what you’re going to get. I feel like that’s just another part of marriage, like, how are you going to be? But now he has held my hair when I threw up and has gotten me food. He has been the best. He’s awesome.”</p><p>Robertson added that the Auburn University grad, 22, has been “laughing” at the cravings she has now that she’s back to broadening her palate. “Every day I’m like, ‘I need a quesadilla,’” she said.</p><p>The pair <a href=#>wed in November 2019</a> at her family’s farm.
