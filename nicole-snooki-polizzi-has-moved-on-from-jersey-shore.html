I don’t like partying three days in a row. It’s just not my life anymore.”</p><p>Six months later, the finale of Jersey Shore Family Vacation aired, in which Polizzi and her costars got into a fight with <a href=#><strong>Angelina Pivarnick</strong></a> at her wedding. “I’m quitting, I think,” she told <a href=#><strong>Deena Nicole Cortese</strong></a> on the episode, which aired in June 2019. “I think this is it. This is not fun. … I just love my roomies, always. Jersey Shore is literally my life. I never would have met my best friends, so the fact that it has to end like this, for me, it really sucks.”</p><p>Polizzi’s family was also a big part of her decision, as she and husband <strong>Jionni LaValle</strong> share three children, Lorenzo, 8, Giovanna, 6, and Angelo, 18 months.</p><p>“When we came back from Miami, I was gone for two weeks, then I came home for a night and then left for another two weeks. That<a href=#> literally scarred [my oldest son]</a>,” the Snooki & JWoww alum told Us in January. “So anytime I say ‘Mommy’s going to work,’ he’s like, ‘Mom, you cannot leave me again like you did. I was so upset. I don’t want you leaving.’ So now every time I say I’m leaving for work, he goes, ‘How long are you leaving?’ It kind of gives him anxiety now. I can’t do that anymore. They are definitely happy that I’m not going to be leaving for days on end now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nicole-Snooki-Polizzi-Has-Moved-On-From-Jersey-Shore-Cast.jpg><p>Despite not being part of the show, the Chile native <a href=#>is still quite a fan</a> — and still views her castmates as her family.</p><p>“Good luck my fam,” she tweeted in June following the news that the series had been renewed for a fourth season. “Can’t wait to watch!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jersey Shore Family Vacation airs on MTV Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKWim5%2Bhsm6%2FzaimpKFdpbyttdmzoGagkah6rrvVnptmp55is7O7zGahnqqjmsZuv8eoqZ5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
