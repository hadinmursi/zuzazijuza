Gwyneth Paltrow resents, understandably, being called the “Most Hated Celebrity,” which is exactly what Star magazine called her in a 2013 rankings list.

“First of all, I was like, ‘I’m the most hated celebrity? More than, like, Chris Brown?’ What did I do?” Paltrow, 43, asked host Stephen Sackur at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

More than, like, Chris Brown?’ What did I do?” Paltrow, 43, asked host Stephen Sackur at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. (Brown was No. 20 on the list.)</p><p>The Mortdecai actress understands that at times she can come off as pretentious and privileged, however. Her lifestyle site, <i>Goop</i>, which she launched in 2008, has raised eyebrows <a href=#>over the years for its pricey products.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>Additionally, some of Paltrow’s comments about food have received backlash. Back in April, she wrote on her </span><i>Goop</i><span> blog </span><a href=#>that she’d rather smoke crack than eat spray cheese.</a></p><p>“I see where you are coming from, but maybe you just make people feel bad sometimes,” Sackur said.</p><p>Paltrow replied: “All I can do is be my authentic self, and if you know me, then you know who I am, and that I have fun and eat and am so appreciative for my life. But I think there are things about me that make people draw conclusions.”</p><p>The mom of two realizes that her upbringing can also rub people the wrong way. (Paltrow is the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and the late film director Bruce Paltrow.) But told Sackur that she worked hard to get where she is today.</p><p>“That inspires a lot of resentment,” Paltrow said. “My parents [director Bruce Paltrow and actress Blythe Danner] did well, and I was able to go to a fantastic school, and we grew up in New York City, but the minute I left my college to try to pursue acting, my father was really supportive. But he said, you know, ‘You are completely on your own.’ So, he never gave me anything. I never had any supplementation, he never helped me with my rent, I never had a trust fund. So the idea that I am spoiled or that I didn’t work for what I have is just not accurate, but I can see how somebody might have that perception.”</p><p>Paltrow wasn’t the only woman to be named as one of the most hated celebrities in Hollywood. The tabloid included Kristen Stewart (No. 2), Anne Hathaway (No. 9), Lindsay Lohan (No. 16) and her former BFF Madonna (No. 7).</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagr6mjsrW0jKmYpayipMRuvsSamq2rXam8brnOrKtmoJGpsqV5wp6jnpqinsG6edOiq6WdXax%2Fcn2WbXBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
