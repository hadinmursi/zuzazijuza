One day before Clooney’s much-anticipated nuptials to Alamuddin, the new mom also revealed one of <a href=#>her favorite baby products</a>. “I adore these baby baskets for their convenience and cottony comfort,” she tweeted.</p><p>Clooney and Keibler split in July 2013 after two years of dating. Keibler went on to marry entrepreneur <strong>Jared Pobre </strong>this past March in a secret ceremony; the couple welcomed their first child, daughter <strong>Ava</strong>, last month.</p><p>Still, <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly </strong>revealed</a> this past May that the Supermarket Superstar hostess was “irked” by her ex-boyfriend’s engagement to the British human rights attorney, 36. “When George and Stacy got together, he told her she would be the one he’d marry—and that they could have kids,” <a href=#>a source told <strong>Us</strong></a>. Countered a second insider, “Stacy’s happy for George. She is glad he was able to find true love.”</p><p>As for his other recent ex, Canalis? Clooney dated the Italian model and actress for 18 months before splitting in June 2011. Like her successor Keibler, Canalis also found her happily ever after recently with orthopedic surgeon Brian Perri, whom she married just two weeks ago — and in Italy, too (Sardinia).</p><p>A Dancing With the Stars alum just like Keibler, Canalis, 36, spent her weekend hitting the California surf on Friday, Sept. 27, <a href=#>wearing a skimpy blue bikini</a>. On Clooney’s wedding day, she took to Instagram <a href=#>to reminisce</a> about her own nuptials. “Two weeks ago, in this very moment, I did not know what to expect,” she reflected alongside an image of herself on her big day, holding her wedding gown. Throughout Clooney’s wedding weekend, Canalis shared additional images of herself on her big day.</p><p>Mancano ancora pochi giorni per avere l’abito <a href=#>@CharityGiftRoom</a> e <a href=#>@CharityStars</a> ed aiutare <a href=#>http://t.co/M7j7O8sGYM</a> ?? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ifyNDfI5vY</a></p><p>— ElisabettaCanalis (@JustElisabetta) <a href=#>September 26, 2014</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Canalis’ rep <a href=#>confirmed to <strong>Us</strong></a> in August that the actress and Perri planned to tie the knot in the same month and country as Clooney. A source said that Canalis was “happy for” Clooney, elaborating: “They have both moved on to find their own happiness.” The actress later told Italy’s Chi magazine, reflecting: “I am happy for him, but I am thinking only of my happiness. It is the most important day of my life, I don’t have time to think of anyone else.”</p><p>Clooney, 53, on the most important day of his life, <a href=#>exchanged hand-written vows</a> with Alamuddin in a Venetian ceremony before guests like <strong><a href=#>Cindy Crawford</a></strong>,<strong> Bono</strong>, <strong><a href=#>Matt Damon</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Emily Blunt</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Anna Wintour</a></strong>. “Clooney held Amal’s hand when saying part of his vows,” an insider tells <strong>Us</strong> of the romantic ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagnZ%2BntKZ5wqWmqKaVrsBuw8Sdm6Kml2KyubHSZqqtmZOueqyxyJujnqpdmrmqv8CbnK2skWKworrApaCsZaSssqbAjGtnamxiboZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
