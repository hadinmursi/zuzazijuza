German dance duo La Bouche (who are most famous for their 1995 hit “Be My Lover”) are also listed as performers, which would be a welcome addition to the potential collaboration, if you ask <i>Us.</i></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here’s a conversation starter. Not sure what this means but it certainly made me say WTF?! What are you up to <a href=#>@Xtina</a>? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eDCu72Y6UY</a></p><p>— Christina VIP (@FighterFamiIy) <a href=#>December 7, 2016</a></p><p>“Here’s a conversation starter,” the fan captioned the screenshot. “Not sure what this means but it certainly made me say WTF?! What are you up to @Xtina?”</p><p>Naturally, fans of both Spears, 35, and Aguilera, 35, lost their minds on social media.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“SO THERES A RUMOR ABOUT A BRITNEY AND CHRISTINA COLLAB?! YALL IM SHOOK AS F–K IVE BEEN WAITING 19 YEARS FOR THIS,” one Twitter user enthused, while another jokingly wrote: “If this Britney and Christina collab is a lie I’m fighting everyone idc.”</p><p>The former teen idols have been pitted against each other since they both burst onto the music scene in the late ‘90s, several years after starring on Disney’s <i>All New Mickey Mouse Club </i>together. While Aguilera was celebrated for her powerhouse vocals, Spears was best known for her wow-worthy dance moves and polarizing stage presence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2441584_britney-spears-madonna-christina-aguilera-zoom-a4e7f1b4-8b67-4184-ac53-f7e4bf1659d5.jpg><p>Despite their rivalry, the women worked together in 2003 when they accompanied <b>Madonna</b> for a memorable — and controversial — performance of Her Madgesty’s hits “Like a Virgin” and “Hollywood” at the MTV Video Music Awards. Both Spears and Aguilera kissed the superstar on the lips during the steamy number.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During a 2012 press conference for <i>The Voice,</i> Aguilera had nothing but sweet things to say about Spears when she was asked a question about the “Lucky” songstress joining competing reality TV show <i>The X Factor.</i> “[We were in the] <i>Mickey Mouse Club</i>. We were very close, and our paths have always crossed and, interestingly, they will continue to cross,” Aguilera told reporters. “I welcome her to this family of fun and entertainment and finding new talent as well. … I don’t know what [advice] she’s going to offer specifically, but I know she’s a pro. … I think she’s going to give great advice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJirnV2Xv6rAzZ6wZqugmq6zv4yapZ1lk52%2Fqr%2FToqWaZZGcwqq4xKuYZqqVmLyzsMinnmaZXZnCpsCMsGtubGRof3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
