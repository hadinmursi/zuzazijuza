The family eventually relocated to Flint, Michigan when Sam was 14 years old. He began working as a butcher when he was 16, and was on his way to a career as a grocer by the time he was 18. He caught the acting bug a few years later, and enrolled in the American Academy of the Dramatic Arts, which had just opened a school on the West Coast.

Over the course of the next seven years, he would work for three different agencies, slowly building a positive reputation in Hollywood.</p><p>In 1986, he opened his own agency, SGA Representation, Inc. SGA went on to become the very powerful agency known as Paradigm, for which Mr. Gores currently serves as Chairman. Past and present clients have included Adrien Brody, Chris Copper, Neil Patrick Harris, Aerosmith, Coldplay, The Black Eyed Peas, and The Fray, among many other successful artists.</p><p><strong>Real Estate</strong>: In 2012 Sam paid $2.35 million for a condo in West Hollywood.
