I really am starting to relate to them, especially the older one. She’s going through things now that I can really relate to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Stepmom-Brittany-Aldean-Feels-Like-Big-Sister-to-Jason-Aldean-Daughters.jpg><p>The<a href=#> American Idol</a> alum went on to admit that “being a stepparent is a difficult” role. She explained to Us, “Sometimes it’s a thankless position, but I’m very, very fortunate in the fact that the girls are awesome. They love me, I love them. We get along very well. I’m really thankful that they’re the ones that I’m in this position with.”</p><p>Jason, 43, and his ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Jessica Ussery</strong></a>’s girls actually sent Brittany “the best <a href=#>Mother’s Day</a> messages,” she gushed.</p><p>Coparenting with Ussery, 40, has been “kind of hard” while quarantining amid the coronavirus pandemic. “We didn’t see his daughters for about a month because it was the beginning of the whole issue,” the North Carolina native told Us. “We didn’t really know what was going on at that house, and they didn’t really know what was going on at ours. For a little bit, it was just like, ‘Stay put, we will see you. We just got to let this thing die down.’”</p><p>She and Jason quarantined with their kids — <a href=#>Memphis</a>, 2, and <a href=#>Navy</a>, 15 months — and saw Keeley and Kendyl when they were safe. “It’s definitely difficult because you’re trying to not get your household sick, and so is everyone else,” Brittany said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The&nbsp;University&nbsp;of Alabama graduate is really thankful for South Beach amid the stay-at-home orders, she told Us, explaining, “We walk about two and a half miles in the morning and then we just try to eat really well throughout the day. Thank the Lord for South Beach. We’re trying to eat as healthy as possible because we’re not able to go to a gym and exercise that much.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasrJWlurC5jJupoqyklru6ecClm56ZnmK2tHnLoqKeZZKetG6%2FyKyrnqpdqbxutsCspqerXZmutrPHrZyrq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
