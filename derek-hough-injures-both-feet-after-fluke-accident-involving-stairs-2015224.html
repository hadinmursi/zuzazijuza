But then a fluke accident happened that involved a light and some stairs. Can't believe it, wish I had a cooler story to tell,” Hough captioned a photo from his hospital bed on Wednesday. “All that dancing, flipping, jumping and the thing that stops me in my tracks is something as simple as a light and some stairs. I'm doing everything I possibly can to have a quick recovery and I'm determined to come back stronger than ever. I appreciate all the love and support, you guys are the best. And thank you to Mark, BC Jean and Corky Ballas for staying with me at the hospital until 2am. Love you. This is new territory for me, I'm usually able to work through injury but this one has literally floored me. But like I said before I'm determined to come back all guns blazing…soon!!! #setbackisasetupforacomeback.”</p><p>Hough’s rep told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> in a statement that the injury occurred while rehearsing for Tuesday's anniversary special — in which Hough was supposed to perform with former partner <strong>Maria Menounos</strong>.</p><p>“Derek Hough suffered injuries to his right foot and left ankle,” his rep explained to <strong>Us</strong>. “He has been diagnosed with a broken toe on his right foot and sprains to his left ankle on both the inside and outside aspects and a bone bruise on the same ankle.
