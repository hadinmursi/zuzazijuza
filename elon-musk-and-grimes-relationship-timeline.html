However, it has not always been smooth sailing for the businessman and the singer. They weathered split rumors and a very public <a href=#>feud with <strong>Azealia Banks</strong></a> in August 2018 before reuniting.</p><p>Fans speculated about their status for months, as the pair continued to be spotted together everywhere from the Kardashian-Jenner family Christmas party to China.</p><p>Musk and Grimes seemingly confirmed they were back on when she announced in January 2020 that she was <a href=#>pregnant</a>. Though she did not caption her Instagram photo that showed off her baby bump, she referred to herself as “knocked up” in the comments section.</p><p>Nearly two months later, the Canada native revealed in a&nbsp;<a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;profile that the Tesla CEO was the father of her child. She opened up in the interview about the impact of their relationship on her career. “No one believes me about this, but I just did not understand what I was getting into at all,” she explained. “Not that I’m mad about it. I just didn’t think it would be a thing. The s–t that’s happened with my boyfriend this year has overwritten so much of my life’s work.”</p><p>Grimes described her pregnancy as a major decision, made in part because of her trust in Musk. “For a girl, it’s sacrificing your body and your freedom. It’s a pretty crazy sacrifice and only half of the population has to do it. It was really profound to me when I decided I was going to do it, to actually go through the act of like, y’know, unprotected sex,” she admitted. “I’m just like, ‘I have sacrificed my power in this moment. I have, like, capitulated.’ And I have spent my whole life avoiding that situation. I have never capitulated to anything, so it was just a profound commitment.”</p><p>She added: “I do actually just really love my boyfriend. So I was like, ‘You know, sure.’”</p><p>In September 2021, <a href=#>the businessman told Page Six</a>, “[Grimes and I] are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently and are on great terms.”</p><p class=p1>The “Realiti” artist confirmed in a March 2022 <i>Vanity Fair&nbsp;</i>profile that<a href=#> the pair welcomed daughter Exa Dark Sideræl Musk via surrogate</a> in December 2021. Several hours after the article’s publication, Grimes confirmed that the pair had called it quits.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Me and E have broken up *again* since the writing of this article haha, but he’s my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now,” <a href=#>she&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;at the time</a>. “I think Devin wrote that part of the story rly well. Sique – peace out.”</p><p>Scroll to revisit the milestones from Grimes and Musk’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksq27zWakrqubYq6vsIygqaKllah6s7HLmquip56otaq8jK2gpp2cnrumew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
