I’ll just go and sit in my own seat, which is right across the way,’ but he’s, like, a complete gentleman.”</p><p>The California native announced in March that she and Bloom, 43, are <a href=#>excepting their first child together</a>.

I’m used to going [out] all the time. … There is not really anywhere to go besides my car. So I go to my car a lot. That is my safe space.”</p><p>That same month, Perry went on to tell <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable>Radio.com</a>&nbsp;that <a href=#>she was “spiraling” while quarantining</a>. “All perfectionist slash control freaks are spiraling right now. … But I also chalk it up to the uncertainty of being pregnant for the first time and having a child and not knowing [the future].”</p><p>The singer started dating Bloom in 2017 and <a href=#>got engaged</a> to the Pirates of the Caribbean star two years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakmaSuerGx0auwZquYlr%2Bmv4ysrp6dpGLEosWMoZirqqliwLXFy56qZqqVlrC1scNmq6hloKeyqLrAp5qyZZ6axLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
