Has the wrestling world been taking a nap! 
Tully Blanchard is lacing up his boots one more time and teaming with the best tag team in the world, FTR. Now don’t be foolish enough to think that he think he can do the things he once could."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Their last match together came on November 5, 1989, a tag team loss to Demolition at a WWE live event in Waukegan, Illinois. Tully was fired by WWF later that month and made appearances throughout the 1990s in AWA, ECW and WCW, among other promotions; his last match as an active wrestler came on August 10, 2007 against Dustin Rhodes at&nbsp;NWA Legends Fanfest in Charlotte.</p><p>Dax Harwood, who has no problem sharing his own excitement for Tully’s return, agreed with the sentiment and <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>&nbsp;‘We got room for one more…’ and teased an invite for another horse to join the stable.</p><p>NXT and AEW Dynamite delivered another action-packed Wednesday night. AEW TNT Champion Darby Allin ziplined into the ring to aid Sting to build to their Street Fight at the Revolution PPV against Brian Cage and Ricky Starks. This week’s Dynamite also saw more teases for next week’s big celebrity tag team match with Shaquille O’Neal and Jade Cargill taking on Cody Rhodes and Red Velvet. Plus analysis on AEW’s shocking acquisition of Paul Wight (‘the Big Show’) and much more.</p><p>On NXT, the Undisputed Era’s split became complete as Adam Cole lured in Roderick Strong during a show-closing confrontation that involved NXT Champion Finn Balor only to low-blow him. Karrion Kross faced NXT Cruiserweight Champion Santos Escobar in a wild NO DQ match and much more. Will NXT have a Takeover around WrestleMania season?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFra21tYmKus7qMmqWdnaKovK95066jpbFdl7miusKhmKucXZayuHnRnquuqp5iwam10magrGWknbJuw8Cy</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
