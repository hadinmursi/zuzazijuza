How John Cena and Daniel Bryan have influenced their training:
Nikki Bella: Actually, when John and I first started dating, I was coming back from breaking my leg. Before that, I was just the type of girl who would do cardio at the gym, lift some free weights, and take some classes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Below are some interview highlights:</p><p>How <a href=#>John Cena</a> and <a href=#>Daniel Bryan</a> have influenced their training:</p><p>Nikki Bella: Actually, when John and I first started dating, I was coming back from breaking my leg. Before that, I was just the type of girl who would do cardio at the gym, lift some free weights, and take some classes. So when I was getting back into shape, he introduced me to Olympic lifting. I always had this perception that when you lift weights, you’re going to get bulky and thick. I didn’t realize you actually burn a lot of fat and that it trims you down. So when John got me past that, I just fell in love with this style of weightlifting. It has totally transformed my body.</p><p>Brie Bella: If Bryan is like, “I’m going to be at the gym here for two hours,” it forces me to keep myself busy for those two hours. It pushes you more! And Bryan is actually the first relationship I’ve been in where my partner enjoys a healthy lifestyle like me. Even past lifting weights at the gym. I’ve never had a loved one to go hiking with me, or to do yoga with me. And that has actually changed me. Now instead of being like, “Hey, lets go to happy hour!” it’s like, “Lets go find this mountain to hike.”</p><p>On people working out with loved ones:</p><p>Brie Bella: I think working out with a loved one makes everything feel better! And for us, we’re constantly on the road. So I’m always looking for extra time to hang out with Bryan. When we get to work out together, yes, we’re doing something for our health. But at the same time we’re actually getting to spend some time together.</p><p>How guys should approach women at the gym:</p><p>Nikki Bella: When she is on the treadmill, leave her alone! I can’t tell you how many guys have approached me when I’m doing cardio. Like, I have my headphones on, I’m in the zone, so don’t bother me. I think the best time to approach a woman is actually after her workout. When you’re working out, you’re playing your jam, you’re in the groove, and you don’t want to be interrupted. So guys, wait until she’s done getting her sweat on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpBybGxxXam1pnnBnqOlmV2pxKq60marmqSbYsCmr9Geq6xlpKR6sbXCpKCnn12qvW7Dzqacp2WRqXq1tMRmnrKlXZ28uHnCnqWaZZGjsW6u0bKYp2WYlsOmecinnaWtlaOwprCMrZ%2BeoaJis6rAzZ6qrGWipMK1tc2eqmaln6ey</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
