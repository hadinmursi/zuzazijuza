His marriage to Kyla Weber in 2010 coincides with the decrease in romantic comedy roles in Vaughn's career.

Because of the similar type of characters he often plays, audiences everywhere have gotten used to his quirky wit and unique deadpan style.</p><p>One thing that has not gone unnoticed by his fans in the recent past is Vaughn's switch from romantic comedy movies to more diverse and challenging roles. The gradual change has those who follow his work wondering what the source of the shift is. Many fans and industry followers wonder whether this pivot is due to the thoughts of his new wife and her feelings regarding his career.</p><h2 id=vince-vaughn-got-married-in-2010>Vince Vaughn Got Married In 2010</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vince-vaughn-looking-shocked.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After several failed Hollywood relationships, Vince Vaughn fell in love with <a href=#>a real estate agent from Canada, Kyla Weber</a>. The two married in 2010 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed their daughter the same year</a>, followed by a son in 2013.</p><p>Weber has managed to stay out of the Hollywood spotlight for the most part, which means that there isn't much that the world knows about the one who captured the actor's heart.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Vince Vaughn Really Felt About Working With Jon Favreau In Couples Retreat</a></span></p><p>It is said that Vaughn was introduced to Weber through a mutual friend in the winter of 2007 and the two hit it off instantly. Additionally, it's been mentioned that after just four months of dating Vaughn introduced his new love to his parents.</p><p>Being that his mother is also a real estate agent, it's likely that the two hit off during their meet and greet. The couple were engaged in 2009 and married the following year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vince-stopped-acting-in-romantic-comedies>Vince Stopped Acting In Romantic Comedies...</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Vince-Vaughns-Wife-Kyla-Weber.jpg><p>Many have noticed <a href=#>a change in Vaughn's film credentials</a>. While he previously engaged in a great deal of work that involved romantic comedies, they have largely swung in a different direction in recent years.</p><p>Not only has the actor and star taken on more of a production role in the entertainment world, but he has also expanded to new types of roles that deviate from his standard persona.</p><p>As a stark difference from his Delivery Man and Mr. and Mrs. Smith characters, Vaughn took the leap to act in a horror film in 2020. The film, Freaky, depicts a young girl who switches bodies with a serial killer and has just a short period of time to switch herself back before the change becomes permanent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Isla Fisher Requested A Body Double For A Scene With Vince Vaughn In Wedding Crashers And She Was Completely Right</a></span></p><p>In looking through the history of Vaughn's work, many can see that around the time of his marriage is when the work that included romantic comedies dropped off. However, it should be noted that this period of time was also when Vaughn and his new wife were growing their family, welcoming two children in the span of three years.</p><p>Therefore, it's not a guarantee that the marriage and the change in movie roles have a connection.</p><h2 id=how-does-vince-39-s-wife-kyla-weber-feel-about-his-work>How Does Vince's Wife Kyla Weber Feel About His Work?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vince-Vaughn-In-Freaky.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being that Vince Vaughn has dated several well-known celebrity women (<a href=#>Jennifer Aniston credits him with healing her heart post-Brad</a>) and starred beside them in films, it would be understandable for his wife to feel uncomfortable with his work.</p><p>However, Kyla Weber is notoriously private, and little information is divulged about her personal life. Therefore, it is unknown how she feels about her husband's acting career.</p><p>Being a career woman herself where she is still occupying the same role as she did before marrying, it's assumed that Weber understands being devoted to one's work. However, it has to be said that there is a distinct level of difference between selling houses (her profession) and getting romantic with other women (his profession) while on the clock.</p><p>Therefore, it's possible that Weber may have taken issue with the intimacy surrounding his work, especially with not being in the entertainment world herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wedding-crashers.jpg><p>In the case of Vince's past relationships with other actresses, many have been in a similar position and understand how the world works in that regard. For someone coming in from the outside, and from a much different career path, experiencing this can be overwhelming and bring forth a sense of hesitation and anxiety.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Vince Vaughn's Mom Was Conned Out Of A Whopping $25 Million: Here's Whether Or Not Her Net Worth Ever Recovered</a></span></p><p>So while Vince Vaughn may be respecting his wife's wishes and has chosen to move away from romantic comedies as a result of his marriage and family, that isn't something that has come out from the couple, their friends, or their associates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alternatively, the star himself has said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is grateful to have waited to get married and have kids</a> until he was older.</p><p>Vaughn continues to say that he feels good about being single for so many years and holding off on a wife and children until he matured more. With that, perhaps it was just a natural progression for Vaughn to want to encompass a new lifestyle both in his immediate circle and in his professional life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbymv82tZK%2BhnpiybsLArp6hpl2ZvG6%2BzqaYp6yZmHqku8yem6Kdo2Kur8XMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
