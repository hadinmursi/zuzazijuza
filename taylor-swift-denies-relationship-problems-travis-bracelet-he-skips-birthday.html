It’s also how Travis and Taylor first connected; he tried to give her a bracelet with his phone number on it after attending her concert. Travis made the admission on his podcast, which he co-hosts with his brother Jason Kelce.</p><p>Though Travis said the attempt was unsuccessful, his podcast comments apparently caught the attention of Taylor. Within a few weeks, the couple were seen hanging out publicly, and they’ve been going strong ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reports-say-travis-is-getting-ready-to-propose-to-taylor>Reports Say Travis Is Getting Ready To Propose To Taylor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51804042-1.jpg><p>Speaking to <a href=#>TIME Magazine</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> earlier this month</a>, Taylor revealed that their relationship didn’t start with their first public outing. Rather, they began seeing each other privately after Travis’ podcast comments caught Taylor’s attention.</p><p>“This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” she told the outlet.</p><p>“We started hanging out right after that,” Taylor went on. “So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard-launch a first date.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, reports have suggested the pair are getting serious quickly. Not only is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor living at Travis’ $6 million Kansas mansion</a> in between tour stops and other obligations, but he’s also apparently gearing up to propose to her. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">report claims it could happen over Christmas</a>.</p><p>Taylor broke up with Joe Alwyn after six years together at the start of 2023, amid reports that his hesitation to get married played a part. If the rumors are true, perhaps Taylor will get the engagement she wants with Travis, possibly even before the end of the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llJq7qrHSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWgp7yjuMSmqmasopbDqr%2BMm6mam5WhsrV5x55krKOZpcBursirq6Gcka58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
