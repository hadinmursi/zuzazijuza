He recently came back from a lengthy hiatus to focus on his stand-up comedy career, so it's unknown how much longer he wants to wrestle for - and if Ziggler&nbsp;prefers a full or part-time schedule down the road.</p><p>Balor and Nakamura are among WWE's greatest talents that have been poorly booked by the company, so it wouldn't be a surprise if they both looked to leave down the road. The Revival have yet to sign new contracts with WWE, while Harper revealed in April that he <a href=#>asked to be released</a>. And as for Banks, she has been on hiatus since WrestleMania 35, and it's unknown if she'll be returning to WWE.</p><p><strong>What This Means</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WWE has been doing their best to retain their talents by offering five-year deals with large amounts of money. They<a href=#> kept Mike and Maria Kanellis</a> when it looked like both were ready to depart. It'll be interesting to see down the road which superstars try to leave for AEW, and which ones take the money and stick around in WWE.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>Next:<a class=bc-title-link title="Baron Corbin Chooses Lacey Evans As Guest Referee, Rollins Retains" href=#>Baron Corbin Chooses Lacey Evans As Guest Referee, Rollins Retains</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeemsS0e8Ooo6mgXa%2B2qLPLnqlmmpWpwaq6xmamnZyjYq6mw44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
