You know what I mean? It’s like, how do I please everybody?”</p><p>Harrison assured Matt that “the most important thing is if you come out of this with joy, peace, love, and you have this amazing woman who shares those things.”</p><p>While Matt’s journey to find love just began on ABC, he<a href=#> teased to Us Weekly that he became “emotionally attached”</a> to several of his contestants.</p><p>“I think [falling for multiple women is] just something that comes with the territory because when people are sharing these things with you and you’re sharing things with them, it’s only natural that over time you’re going to form some type of feeling for that person,” he told Us ahead of the premiere. “How you choose to act on that is another thing, but the raw feeling of being attracted, interested, seeing that person as someone that you could be with — there was a lot of that.”</p><p>The realtor added that he is “undeserving” of his “great” group of women.</p><p><strong>Why did Colton Underwood have to stay 100 yards away from Cassie Randolph?

That’s why I was so skeptical coming in, because it’s like, you don’t think the type of woman exists that I was interacting with and that were part of this experience.
