The cookbook author is known for experimenting with alternative therapies — she’s tried everything from leech facials to vaginal steaming — so it’s not a surprise that she would opt for the holistic approach of facial acupuncture in lieu of conventional anti-aging cosmetic procedures."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Iron Man star told Harper’s Bazaar back in 2013, “I’ll try anything. Except I won’t do Botox again, because I looked crazy.”</p><p>According to the actress’ acupuncturist, Paul Kempisty LAc, who has been overseeing her acupuncture and aromatherapy treatments in his New York City Soho neighborhood office for three years, “facial acupuncture, also known as facial rejuvenation acupuncture, is performed much like regular acupuncture but with a particular focus on supporting connective tissue, circulation and detoxification of the face.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The one-hour treatment gives “a beautifying effect by promoting all around radiant health and bringing balance to the whole body,” he tells Us Weekly. “The local face points also specifically promote wound healing, collagen production, circulation and relaxed and supple muscles on the face and often produces a feeling of deep relaxation and rejuvenation during and after the procedure.”</p><p>The Oscar winner, who is currently prepping for her <a href=#>upcoming nuptials</a> to producer <strong>Brad Falchuck</strong>, is not letting <a href=#>wedding planning</a> interrupt her regularly scheduled wellness routine. “At this time of year, Gwyneth receives acupuncture approximately once per week,” Kempisty shares. “Once the needles are out, Gwyneth usually has an aromatherapy essential oil treatment where I choose very specific therapeutic grade essential oils and apply them one by one on her back. They’re gently massaged and finally covered with a hot towel compress to really amplify the relaxing and healing properties of any acupuncture treatment.”</p><p>Kempisty, who is also certified in Chinese Medicine, even created a <a href=#>collection of bath soaks</a> inspired by Paltrow’s treatments. “It was actually the profound healing effects of these aromatherapy treatments that led to my collaboration with Gwyneth to create Goop’s bath soaks,” he tells Us. “They combine unique healing salts and minerals with herbs and essential oils to provide a truly amazing bath experience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGagr6mjsrW0jKmYpayipMRusM6eqmaekZi2oriMmpquqKWjsLXB0Z5kn6eiYq6vecClo2amkanCs63LZp6lp6dk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
