My back had just started going bad before that fight, from the pro wrestling. So I made the mistake of taking an oxycodone, and when you do that it’s like you’re in water up to your neck…you’re moving slow, you can’t think,” he said. “So I shouldn’t have done that, I should’ve just waited the extra hour and taken it after the fight.”</p><p>While Frye regrets the issue, he did also discuss wrestling alongside Shamrock in a tag-team match with The Great Muta. “He and I were tag-teams against Muta and another fella, and it was pretty neat because I think after the match, he attacked me or I attacked him,” he said with a laugh. Frye went on to say that he thinks the fight against Shamrock was a turning point in both of their careers, but not for the better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9yaWpoYWKxsLqMn6mynV2prq230madop%2BYqbavs4yknKdlo52urr7OnKJmr6KawLW4yKeeZpmcpLuov8idnGagmaI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
