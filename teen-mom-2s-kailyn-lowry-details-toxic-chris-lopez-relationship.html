Kailyn Lowry broke down on Teen Mom 2 when looking back at her tumultuous relationship with ex-boyfriend Chris Lopez.
The reality star, 28, detailed the highs and lows of her on-again, off-again relationship with Lopez, 26, during the Tuesday, October 27, episode of the MTV series.
The episode touched on Lowry’s fourth pregnancy — her second child with Lopez — and revealed how she really felt when Lopez’s aunt posted a photo of her ultrasound on social media, announcing the big news before she could."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He has been in and out of jail.”</p><p>The “Coffee Convos” podcast cohost <a href=#>welcomed the pair’s second son</a>, Creed, in July, and revealed that this time around, <a href=#>her motherhood journey wasn’t smooth</a>.</p><p>“I think what has transpired over the last few months between Chris and I <a href=#>has just been so eye-opening</a>,” she said in her confessional. “I know that people have a ton of questions and they’re wondering how I could have gone back to someone like that.”</p><p>While holding back tears, Lowry added, “I think there’s a lot to be said that I haven’t really talked about in a relationship where domestic violence is there and where it’s just really toxic. I’m still trying to figure that stuff out.”</p><p>Lowry, who also shares <a href=#>3-year-old son Lux</a>, with Lopez, has decided to focus on her children over the past few months.</p><p>“As of right now, I have no intentions of including Chris in anything and so going into this one knowing he won’t be there at all is really scary,” she explained. “I think I let certain people into my life knowing that they were toxic and I ignored a lot of red flags. And I think I let them stay too long to the point where I lost myself.”</p><p>After welcoming Creed, the Hustle and Heart author opened up to Us Weekly about <a href=#>her coparenting arrangement</a> with Lopez, saying they take it “one day at a time” when raising their boys.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[We] don’t communicate right now.
