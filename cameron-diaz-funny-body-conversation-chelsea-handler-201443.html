It’s Me Chelsea, told her roaring audience, “You have to keep it clean you guys.”</p><p>Diaz, who then provided a brief summary of her “In Praise of Pubes” excerpt, explained to Handler: “I figure there’s a purpose for that hair.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“No matter how you enjoy grooming it throughout your life, whether it’s like shave it all off, wax it all off, put a bullseye, birthday cake, I don’t care. Just girls, think about not taking it all off forever. Permanency forever, ever, means forever. It doesn’t come back,” Diaz said, urging against eloctrolysis, laser hair removal, and similar measures.</p><p>“And then you break up with guy who likes it now, and you start to date a guy who don’t like that, and then your stuck,” the Other Woman star said of a hypothetical dating scenario.</p><p>Watch and tell <strong>Us</strong> what you think of Diaz’s advice!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacmZ2av7C6jJ2gmrJdm8KvuthmmaicqWKwsLrVnqmsmaSevK95wqGcpauVlnqprc2do56qXWd9coCTbGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
